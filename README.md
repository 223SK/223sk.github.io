I teach 8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, and 11<sup>th</sup> Grade Computer Science and Economics at [MS/HS 223: The Laboratory School of Finance and Technology](http://ms223.org). Software Engineering is a required class in our middle school, available to every student, every day.

I am part of the [Software Engineering Pilot](http://sepnyc.org), a DOE program designed to make rigorous technology instruction available to students across New York City.
