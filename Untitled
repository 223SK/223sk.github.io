Two           %s          , both alike in dignity,
In fair           %s          , where we lay our scene,
From ancient           %s           break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross`d           %s           take their life;
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their           %s           bury their parents` strife.
The fearful passage of their           %s           love,
And the continuance of their parents` rage,
Which, but their children`s end, nought could           %s          ,
Is now the           %s           hours` traffic of our stage;
The which if you with           %s                     %s%s           attend,
What here shall           %s          , our toil shall strive to mend.
