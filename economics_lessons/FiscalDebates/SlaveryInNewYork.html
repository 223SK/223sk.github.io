<h4>The New York Draft Riots of 1863</h4>
<p>Black citizens and institutions were attacked in the worst mob violence in American history. <!-- Irish Catholic immigrants had been incited by reports that Republicans wanted to free the slaves and bring them north to replace Irish workers.  --> During four days of rioting, about 120 people were killed as mobs lynched at least a dozen African American men, destroyed draft offices, and burned and looted black neighborhoods and the homes of leading Republicans and abolitionists.</p>

<p>Why did whites in New York City, mostly Irish immigrants, go on a rampage and murder hundreds of people in July 1863?</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon a crowd which could have numbered not less than ten thousand, the majority of whom were ragged, frowzy, drunken women, gathered about the Orphan Asylum for Colored Children—a large and beautiful building and one of the most admirable and noble charities of the city [New York]. When it became evident from the menacing cries and groans of the multitude that danger, if not destruction, was meditated to the harmless and inoffensive inmates, a flag of truce appeared, and an appeal was made in their behalf, by the principal, to every sentiment of humanity which these beings might possess—a vain appeal! ... </p>

<p>[T]he vast crowd rushed in. All the articles upon which they could seize—beds, bedding, carpets, furniture, the very garments of the fleeing inmates, some of these torn from their persons as they sped by—were carried into the streets and hurried off by the women and children who stood ready to receive the goods which their husbands, sons, and fathers flung to their care. </p>

<p>The little ones, many of them assailed and beaten—all, orphans and caretakers, exposed to every indignity and every danger—driven on to the street, the building was fired. This had been attempted whilst the helpless children, some of them scarce more than babies, were still in their rooms...</p>

<p>...The house was fired in a thousand places, and in less than two hours the walls crashed in, a mass of smoking, blackened ruins, whilst the children wandered through the streets, a prey to beings who were wild beasts in everything save the superior ingenuity of man to agonize and torture his victims. </p>
