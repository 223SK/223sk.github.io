June 3, 2002<p>

<font size=2>Dr. Richard P. Mills<br>
Commissioner of Education<br>
The State Education Department<br>
89 Washington Avenue<br>
Albany, New York 12234<p></font>

Dear Dr. Mills:<p>

The National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) strongly supports the New York Civil Liberties Union, the National Coalition Against Censorship, the PEN American Center, the New York Performance Standards Consortium, and the ParentsÕ Coalition to End High-Stakes Testing and others listed in their recent letter protesting the use of expurgated literary texts in the New York English Language Arts Regents Examinations. NCTE, a professional organization of 75,000 members dedicated to improving the quality of instruction in the English language arts at all educational levels, opposes censorship and alteration and rewriting of original texts for use in instruction and, as in this case, in student testing.
<p>
As noted in the Standards for the English Language Arts, a nationally recognized document jointly crafted by both NCTE and the International Reading Association (IRA), a major goal of literature instruction is for students to build an understanding of a variety of cultures and experiences outside their own by reading a wide range of literature. Texts that have been purged of the very words and phrases chosen by their authors to represent various cultures and experiences lose their literary merit and leave their readers with distorted and incomplete impressions. Second, testing students on the basis of their understanding and interpretation of such mangled texts is exceptionally poor examination practice, and considering the high stakes of the Regents Exam, calls the validity the test itself into serious question. As a third point, this covert alteration of texts makes a mockery of the literature, its instruction, and, most importantly, of the student readers themselves.
<p>
NCTE wholly opposes such abridgement or adaptation of texts as a form of censorship. Twenty years ago, the NCTE membership passed a resolution that Òpublishers present the complete text or sections of works which they choose to print, whether in a single text or in an anthology; and that if publishers do abridge or adapt a text, they clearly state in the text that these alterations have occurred, and explain the nature and extent of the abridgment or adaptation in promotional information, teachers' guides, and other support materials.Ó Additionally, as stated above, to examine and score students on the basis of their response to and interpretation of incomplete and altered textsÑtexts which it is possible they have also read in the originalÑis shoddy testing practice.
<p>
NCTE joins with those who urge you to immediately rectify this situation and cease the alteration of the literary texts used on the Regents Exam, to Òrespect the language chosen by the authors it quotes and the students who have worked hard to understand the craft and significance of literature.Ó Further, NCTE joins with parents and students who may legitimately question the validity of the Regents Exam when the examination material, which they interpreted and to which they responded, was falsely represented as original text.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
Kent Williamson<br>
NCTE Executive Director<p>                                
Leila Christenbury<br>
NCTE President
