	<B>2 English Tests Speak</b><p>

By MICHAEL WINERIP<br>
September 17, 2003<p>

THREE years ago, when Ammar Naeem immigrated to Queens from
Pakistan and enrolled at Richmond Hill High School, he did
not speak English. But he has learned much since then. He
has maintained an 87 average, and was named to the school
honor society. Through long hours of study, he has passed
all the state Regents tests required for a high school
diploma in New York, including science, global studies,
math and English. His English Regents score was his best,
78. "Now I know how to speak," said Ammar, who hopes to
study engineering in college. 
<p>
But as Ammar enters his senior year, there are many courses
he would like to take yet cannot, because he is still stuck
taking E.S.L. (English as a Second Language) classes. He
cannot get the advanced math or business courses he wants.
"E.S.L. classes are boring for me," he complained. 
<p>
Ammar is stuck because he failed to pass the state's new
E.S.L. test, introduced in May. He is hardly alone. In
2002, under the old test given by the city, known as LAB,
(Language Assessment Battery), 35 students at Richmond Hill
passed; this year, under the new state test, 4 passed. 
<p>
At Manhattan International, a public high school for
immigrants, 28 of 48 seniors passed the old test in 2002;
this year 2 of 36 did. A New York City official called the
failure rate on the new test "many, many times higher" than
that of previous years. Dr. Eric Eversley, superintendent
in Freeport, N.Y., agreed, saying, "A dramatically higher
number failed." 
<p>
What is more amazing, and confusing, is that - like Ammar -
many of the same students who failed the new E.S.L. test
passed their English Regents diploma test. At Richmond
Hill, 69 students who failed the new E.S.L. test passed the
English Regents test this year. At Manhattan International,
15 who failed the E.S.L. passed the English Regents. 
<p>
"I don't understand," Ammar said. "Passing the English
Regents is supposed to mean I know enough English to
graduate. How come I can't get out of E.S.L. classes?" 
<p>
His E.S.L. teacher, Melanie Fordin, agrees. "It's
ludicrous," she said. "One state test says he's proficient
in English. The other state test says he's not. It's such a
waste to keep students like Ammar segregated in E.S.L.
classes." Ms. Fordin questions the scoring of the new state
test. "Something's wrong," she said. 
<p>
If so, it would not be the first time. In June, after
two-thirds of students failed the Math A test required for
graduation, there was such an outcry that the education
commissioner, Dr. Richard P. Mills, threw out the results.
A blue ribbon commission last month ordered that the
scoring scale be substantially lowered. 
<p>
Last week, the State Board of Regents ordered a review of
the scaling of the new physics test. Until 2002, about 15
percent of physics students - typically the brightest in
the state - failed the physics Regents. Since the new
physics test was introduced in June 2002, 40 percent have
been failing. 
<p>
Tom Dunn, a state spokesman, noted that a student did not
have to pass the E.S.L. test to get a diploma and said the
consequences of failing were actually positive because
students got more language services. He pointed out that
the E.S.L. test included a speaking section, and the
Regents test did not. "Students can do better on reading,
but poorly on speaking," he said, which might explain why
they passed one English test but not the other. 
<p>
But Ms. Fordin said that the speaking and writing sections
were corrected by teachers at the local schools and
estimated that at Richmond Hill, as many 100 students
passed those sections. Reading and listening sections were
multiple choice and sent out to be scored. "We'd like to
see the actual tests," she said. "I can't believe only four
at our school passed." 
<p>
There are now so many tests and accountability systems that
they often send conflicting messages, and it is not just in
New York and not just students like Ammar, who are
proficient in English, but not proficient in English.
Hundreds of schools in Florida that received grades under Gov. Jeb
Bush's state rating system have recently been cited as
failing under President George W. Bush's federal rating
system. 
<p>
Dr. Daniel McCann, deputy superintendent in Rye, one of New
York's richest, highest-achieving suburbs, recently wrote
to Dr. Mills, complaining about how out of whack the state
testing system was. He noted that 79 percent of Rye
students scored mastery (85 percent or higher) on the state
English test; 75 percent scored mastery on the state
history test; and 3 percent scored mastery in physics. "The
disparity in standards is not reasonable or rational," he
wrote, adding that Rye would no longer require the state
physics test. 
<p>
The 56 school districts in Nassau County are now planning
to create their own physics final to replace the state
test. Upstate, Fairport, Skaneateles, Oswego, Auburn and
Jordan-Elbridge are doing the same. 
<p>
If there is to be so much testing, local officials like Dr.
Eversley of Freeport would at least like the results back
promptly for planning purposes. He finds that scores arrive
months after the tests, often too late to identify students
who need extra help or to deploy teachers effectively. Lori
Mei, a senior manager for the city schools, wrote in an
e-mail message that the results of the old LAB test had
been available by June. This time, Dr. Mei wrote, results
arrived so late that city officials did not get them to
schools until after classes had started and E.S.L.
assignments were made. 
<p>
Sylvia Hernandez, a senior at Manhattan International, is
another who passed her English Regents with a 78, but
failed the new E.S.L. test. A Colombian immigrant, Sylvia
works at a pizzeria after school, takes a college course on
Saturdays and hopes to attend New York University next
year. "I don't understand how they're grading this," she
said. 
<p>
At Richmond Hill, names of the four students passing the
new test were posted in the guidance office this week. At
the bottom was the comment, "That's all folks." 
<p>
"Like it was a Warner Brothers cartoon," Ms. Fordin said.

<p>
And while at times it does seem that the state testing
system was thought up by Bugs Bunny, Ms. Fordin, who has
devoted her career to helping children like Ammar and
Sylvia become Americans, thinks she deserves at least as
much say about who needs E.S.L. as the new state test.
