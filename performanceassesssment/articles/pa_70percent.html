	<B>A 70 Percent Failure Rate?</B><p>

By MICHAEL WINERIP   <br>
New York Times<br>
June 25, 2003<P>
 
LONG BEACH, N.Y. <p>

TAKE another tissue, Kim," said the guidance counselor at
Long Beach High School, Patricia Kronick. "It's going to be
O.K., sweetie." <p>

It was Monday afternoon, and Kimberly Rollman could not
stop crying. Ms. Rollman, a senior, had just found out -
three days before graduation - that she had failed the
state's Mathematics A examination and would not be
receiving a diploma. Now a reporter was sitting before her,
asking what it felt like to have worked so hard in high
school and be denied that diploma based on a single state
test, and Kim could not speak. She was crying too hard. <p>

"Kim, take another tissue," said Ms. Kronick, who began to
speak for her. <p>

"Kim is not a student who does the minimum," Ms. Kronick
said. <p>

Kim had passed the state tests in global history, American
history, earth science, biology, chemistry, English and
Spanish. Because she is not good in math, she took a
special prep class for the Math A examination created by
the high school, which also gave her a personal tutor. <p>

"Kim, take another tissue," said Ms. Kronick. Kim had
passed all her courses, including math. And though she does
not have an easy life - she was left by her parents to be
raised by her grandparents - she always managed to make it
to school. Everyone from her principal, Nicholas Restivo,
on down felt that she had earned a diploma. And now a
reporter wanted to know how she felt. <p>

"I don't know how to describe it," she finally whispered.<p>


For days, reporters have been asking students like Ms.
Rollman how it felt. It was not hard to find them. The
state's Council of School Superintendents estimates that 70
percent of those who took the state math test failed.
Seventy percent! Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills is
constantly bragging about what a great testing system he
has created, about all the scientific field testing for the
tests before release. Indeed, Dr. Mills has been a leader
in the national testing movement, mandating that New York
students pass five state tests to graduate. <p>

And so you can imagine, when such a crackerjack testing
operation creates a test that almost everybody flunks - not
to mention all those crying students - it is a big
political problem. After days of being bombarded with
complaints, Dr. Mills said yesterday in a press release
that he was throwing out the test for juniors and seniors.
His statement was intended to sound contrite. <p>

"This situation is unacceptable, and we are taking action
now to protect the children," the release says. But it is
crucial not to lose sight of what the children needed to be
protected from: Dr. Mills's testing program. Dr. Mills even
came up with a novel solution - let students' math grades
determine whether they passed math. And he promised to
assemble a panel of independent experts to review what went
wrong with the math test. <p>

But as Assemblyman Steven Sanders of Manhattan, chairman of
the Assembly Education Committee, says, this is a "seminal
moment" in the state testing program. <p>

And it is not just the math test that needs to be
scrutinized. Physics teachers across the state say they
have had failure rates on the June test that are even
higher than the disastrous results on the widely criticized
physics test last year. In June 2002, 39 percent of the
students failed the test, compared with 11 percent in 2001.
The students who take physics are the smartest in the
state. How did they suddenly get stupid? State officials
ignored their own consultants hired to scale the test and,
at the last minute, changed the scale to make it harder. <p>

Robert Marx, a physics teacher for 11 years at Edward R.
Murrow High School in Brooklyn, says it is even worse this
time. Through the years, Murrow results have mirrored the
statewide pattern. Typically, 90 percent of its students
passed the physics Regents until June 2002, Mr. Marx said,
when 60 percent passed. This year, 40 percent passed, he
said, noting that all those years Murrow has had the same
teachers. <p>

School districts are losing confidence in the tests. Last
fall, for the first time, the superintendents' council
wrote college admissions officers to urge them to disregard
the results of the physics test, which the council termed
"suspect." <p>

William Johnson, superintendent in Rockville Centre, an
upscale suburban Long Island district, did not have his
students take the physics test this year, because he does
not trust the scoring. In Long Beach, scores on the Regents
usually count toward 20 percent of a final grade in a
subject. But even before Dr. Mills threw out the math
results, Long Beach officials had concluded that the math
and physics scores were too unreliable this year to be
trusted in calculating grades. <p>

It goes on and on. Last year, the state was widely
criticized for sanitizing literary excerpts on its English
test, including removing references to Jews and gentiles in
Isaac Bashevis Singer's work. <p>

For Kim Rollman, yesterday's news was great. Her guidance
counselor, Ms. Kronick, tracked her to a hair salon, where
Kim was preparing for the prom. "Thank God," she said. <p>

But for Dr. Mills, the news was not good. A state testing
system that produces a test with what appears to be a 70
percent failure rate is way out of kilter. Something is
radically wrong. This is not just about Math A. It is time
for a rigorous, truly independent review of New York's
entire testing system. Dr. Mills and his band of adults who
have been so certain about the value of standardized tests
to assess children need to be rigorously assessed
themselves.
