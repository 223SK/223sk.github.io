	<B>California Postpones Exit Exam</b><p>

By Greg Winter<br>
New York Times<br>
July 10, 2003<p>


Faced with failure rates that could bar tens of thousands
of students from graduating, the California State Board of
Education voted yesterday to postpone the consequences of
its high school exit exam for two years. <p>

The 9-to-0 decision came in the wake of a state-sponsored
study showing that even if students continued to improve on
the exam, as they typically do each year, about one of
every five seniors would still have failed next year, when
it was supposed to take effect. <p>

By the state's own reckoning, that means as many as 92,000
students would have been denied diplomas in 2004. Now, the
exit exams will take effect in 2006. <p>

"From a moral and ethical point of view, our focus is on
zero failure," said Reed Hastings, the board's president,
adding that the extra time would allow the state's new
curriculum to become "further penetrated into the school
system." <p>

The reprieve in California is the latest example of the
reticence some states have shown when it comes time to
impose the significant consequences of the testing movement
they have pushed so avidly in recent years. More than two
dozen states now have some form of make-or-break exams. <p>

But last fall, Texas relaxed its third-grade reading
standards when it became evident that thousands of students
would be held back after failing a statewide achievement
test. This winter, Georgia decided to push back its "end of
course" exams for a year, switching them to diagnostic
tools rather than requirements for graduation, in part
because they did not reflect the curriculum students had
actually learned. <p>

Two weeks ago, New York voided the results of its math exam
after an abysmally-low passing rate suggested that the test
was too hard and would have cost many students their
diplomas. And, much like California, Alaska delayed its
high school exit exam, originally planned for 2002, for two
years because the test ended up being more demanding than
lawmakers had intended. <p>

"We needed more time to do the job correctly," Harry
Gamble, a spokesman for the Alaska Department of Education
and Early Development. <p>

In California, the problem does not stem from the test
itself, which independent researchers called an accurate
reflection of the academic standards California children
are supposed to learn. Instead, it is that so few students
have grasped those standards that in half the state's
schools, less than 50 percent of next year's seniors have
managed to pass the math part of the exam. Those students
cannot fairly be blamed for failing. <p>

"They simply haven't been taught all of the material that
is being tested," Jack O'Connell, the state superintendent
for public instruction, wrote in an op-ed article for The
Los Angeles Times this week. <p>

Many of the academic fundamentals, like algebra, that
students should have learned years before being tested were
never taught to whole swaths of the population, the state
study found. Moreover, Mr. O'Connell said that the state's
instructional materials were woefully out of date,
reflecting little of the new curriculum that students are
expected to master to pass the exit exam. 
<p>
Two years should be long enough to prepare the younger
grades for the exit exam, Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Hastings
said. The evidence for that projection lies in the fact
that 36 percent of the class of 2004 initially failed the
English part of the exam, though only 21 percent of the
class of 2005 did, a sign, they said, that the new
curriculum has already begun sinking into the lower grades.
<p>

But the delay has done little to appease many opponents of
California's exit exam. They contend that the tests will
continue to have a disparate effect on poor and minority
students because there are fewer qualified teachers and
successful schools in low-income neighborhoods. <p>

According to a study last year by the Center for the Future
of Teaching and Learning, a group that studies teacher
education, students with the highest passing rates in
California were more than twice as likely to have had fully
credentialed teachers as those with the lowest. And since
heavily-minority schools are significantly more likely to
employ teachers without credentials, the testing question
has become a racial issue as well. <p>

"A two-year delay just isn't adequate," said Emily Hobson,
a researcher for Californians for Justice, a group working
to improve education in low-income communities. "The
majority of students of color and low-income students are
experiencing a separate but unequal education." <p>

While Mr. O'Connell agreed with the assertion that teacher
quality is both unequally distributed and an intrinsic part
of passing the exam, he said that the state is working with
inexperienced teachers and giving additional instruction
time to struggling students. The state-sponsored study also
noted these efforts as reasons for optimism, though it
questioned whether accessories like staff training and
extra tutoring would be thrown into jeopardy by
California's fiscal crisis. <p>

With a $38 billion budget shortfall, it is unclear whether
California would be able to summon the financial
wherewithal needed to replace its old books and improve
instruction. Kerry Mazzoni, education secretary for Gov.
Gray Davis, said that every effort would be made to ensure
that enough money is on hand to increase the passing rate,
despite whatever cutbacks will come. "It is certainly
painful to contemplate cuts to education, but given the
magnitude of the deficit, it must be done," she said. 
<p>
Under California law, the board can delay the consequences
of the exit exam only this once. If the passing rate does
not significantly improve in two years, the matter could be
taken up by the legislature or the governor, but the board
characterized this delay as the last one it would need.
