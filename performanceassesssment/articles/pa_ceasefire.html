	<B>Call for a Cease-Fire on Testing</b><p>

By Rep. Major Owens<br>
The Newsletter of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Inc.<br>
September, 2003<p>


No Child Left
Behind legislation
has unleashed a national
testing frenzy
that is generating negative
consequences
for the entire education community;
and African American
children will again be the
biggest losers.
<p>
In light of recent revelations
about the quality of test
questions and the integrity of
the data processing of the
testing companies, the Congressional
Black Caucus
must reassert its position
against the reckless administration
of standardized tests.
<p>
Well meaning destructive
monsters are usually
physical and highly visible
whether it is the giant green
hulk of recent movie fame or
the famous great ape, King
Kong, of several decades ago.
Free and loose in the nation's
schools is a far more destructive
but invisible monster-
the standardized test.
<p>
The No Child Left Behind
legislation has unleashed
this monster which threatens
students, teachers, and the
basic integrity of the education
process. The stakes are very
high. On the basis of test
scores students may be held
back; teachers, principals and
superintendents may be fired;
schools may be closed; and
some school systems may be
restructured or abolished.
In New York City, low
district test scores led to the
dismissal of several superintendents.
In Philadelphia,
low performance throughout
the system provided a rationale
for the state's governor to
launch an effort to privatize
the entire city school system.
Elected officials
at all levels have become
obsessed with
test results. There is
a rush to measure
the output of the education
community
while minimizing the resource
input of the government.
The annual release of
test score results provides the
greatest media opportunities
for public officials to "spin"
the education function in a
profitable partisan manner.
<p>
President Bush's No
Child Left Behind triumph
established a devastatingly
one-sided environment for
education reform. He implemented
national standards
for testing with serious
penalties for failure. At the
same time there is a continuing
refusal to recognize national
standards for "Opportunities-
to-Learn."
<p>
Only the teacher training,
qualifications and certification
provision begins to
push for a significant improvement
in "Opportunities-
to-Learn;" however, the
budget cuts of education
aid undermines the capacity
for meaningful implementation
of this provision.
<p>
School construction and
the improvement of library,
science laboratory and technology
facilities and equipment
remain untouched in
this landmark legislation
which will certainly not be
expanded and improved at
any time soon. While the
testing process gallops forward,
students will not receive
any new resources to
improve their performance.
<p>
The tests will continue to
reign supreme unless some
new initiative is launched to
control them.
<p>
The Congressional Black
Caucus has a long record of
opposition against high
stakes standardized tests.
<p>
Added to the numerous arguments
which expose the
danger of the over reliance
on testing is a newly emerging
crisis-incompetence
and corruption in the testing
industry.
<p>
Indeed, it is first necessary
to see the less than fifteen
companies who publish
and distribute standardized
tests as an industry.
<p>
The new federal legislation
has provided a great
leap forward for the testing
market. The sheer volume
of the surge in new business
has overwhelmed the
following thirteen test
providers:
<p>

<B>Standardized Testing
Companies</B>

<ol>
<li>TSS Vantage Learning
<li>Pearson Educational Measurement
<li>Scantron
<li>Riverside Publishing
<li>Stech Vaughn Company
<li>Measured Progress
<li>Educational Testing Services
<li>CTB McGraw Hill
<li>Renaissance Learning Inc
<li>Princeton Review
<li>Test University
<li>Compuline. Com, Inc.
<li>Edison Schools (AMS)
</ol>

<p>
The following is a listing
of examples illustrating some
of the problems which must
be confronted and overcome:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Incompetence in the
processing of the test
data led to the publishing
of district wide test
scores which were inaccurate;
however, the
New York City Chancellor,
citing low test scores,
had fired several superintendents
before the
company discovered
that a glitch in processing
had reported all of
the scores at a level
lower than the actual
record showed.

<li>Problems with test contents
of the math and
physics in the New York
State Regents Exam led
to the forced resignation
of the official responsible
for the oversight of
state testing.

<li>The scrubbing of test
contents to avoid offending
right wing
zealots is presently
under attack by scholars
who are protesting
the alteration of quotes
from Shakespeare and
other classical writers.

<li>Three traditional companies
continue to dominate
the test design industry
despite the great
geometric increase in the
amount of public school
testing.

<li> Edison Schools, the nation's
leading corporate
advocate for privatizing
education is now a major
wholesaler for tests, raising
a serious conflict-ofinterest
question.
</ul>
<p>

State politicians have
begun to view contracts
for testing as a part of the
patronage pool, thus challenging
quality as the primary
criteria for the selection
of a testing company.
<p>
To save the children the
CBC must lead the fight to
achieve a three year moratorium
on testing mandates.
Legislation to accomplish
this cease-fare will be introduced
in September.
