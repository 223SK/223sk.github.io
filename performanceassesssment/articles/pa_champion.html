	<B>A Champion in the Fight Against Testing Standards</B><p>

By Jay Mathews<br>
Washington Post Staff Writer<br>

Those of us who support the movement to measure educational standards with
tests have had a distinct advantage in debates over this issue. Our
opponents often do not know much about our principal source of
concern--poor kids and their schools.<p>


The leading critics of high-stakes tests often live in places like
Scarsdale, N.Y., some distance from inner city schools. Although the
anti-testers do not actually think of the issue this way, it has been
easy--an old debating trick--to portray them as rich people trying to
protect their little darlings from a few annoying multiple choice tests
when those same tests are vital in keeping track of school progress--or
lack of progress--in low-income neighborhoods.<p>


Well, no more cheap victories for us. The movement against standardized
testing has finally found a champion who cannot be dismissed as a country
club obstructionist. She is Deborah Meier, a fierce opponent of
standardized tests who is also founder of the Central Park East School in
East Harlem, co-principal of the Mission Hill School in Boston, and one of
the most knowledgeable and innovative inner city educators the country has
ever seen.<p>


The Better Late Than Never Book Club--my lonely effort to promote worthy,
if often obscure, writing on education--hereby announces as its latest
selection Meier's new book, "In Schools We Trust: Creating Communities of
Learning in an Era of Testing and Standardization" (Beacon: $23). The BLTN
club usually stumbles across a good book long after it has been published,
because the president and recording secretary is such a slow reader. But I
was looking for a book like this, and Meier caught my attention (just five
weeks after the pub date) by putting a very important word, "trust," in the
title.<p>


It has been clear to me for some time that the fierce argument over how to
help our worst schools arises from a failure of confidence in educators.
Meier herself deserves some blame for this. A generation ago, most
Americans who worried about schools accepted the notion that inner city and
rural teachers were doing their best, but could not be expected to do much
with low-income kids. The assumption was that until their parents got
better jobs and their families grew smaller and less stressful, they would
not be able to learn as quickly or as well as their suburban counterparts.<p>


But then we began to hear of educators who had made remarkable headway with
such children without waiting for a social revolution. There were, among
others, Marva Collins in Chicago, Jaime Escalante in East Los Angeles, and
Meier in New York City. Meier reduced our trust of ordinary teachers by
raising our expectations. With a few other rebel teachers and
administrators, she created small, intimate learning communities for Harlem
kids and succeeded in preparing large numbers of them for college. She
joined with the Annenberg Institute for School Reform to bring the idea to
several other New York schools, and helped start a revolution in small
urban schools that--with a big new dose of money from computer magnate Bill
Gates--is changing education in several cities.<p>


Even at 71, Meier is dealing with kids every day at Mission Hill
Elementary, a pilot school in the heavily minority Roxbury section of
Boston. As she says in her book, the more she sees of the effects of
standardized testing on schools like hers, the more she loathes the idea of
politicians setting school standards and enforcing them with tests.<p>


Among her other talents, Meier is probably the best writer among working
educators today. She is always honest, even when it weakens her case, and
that is why I find her new book so irresistible and so troubling for those
of us who think standards and standardized tests are the only practical way
to keep a messy, easily distracted democratic system concentrated on
helping poor kids learn.<p>


She starts with the fairest and most accurate summary of the standards
movement ever written by a critic of standardized testing: "It's built
around the idea that the villain is mostly low expectations and a failure
of will power. Since both are indisputably factors in failure and less
onerous to tackle than poverty, for example, this notion eliminates
victimology. And it keeps us focused. Ordinary citizens, including parents
and teachers, are aware of how often local parent councils, teacher unions,
principals, and local school boards have abused their powers--here's a way
to catch them. No more excuses."<p>


This movement, she says, is particularly appealing "to those who have the
most reason to distrust our schools: urban minority families and those
inclined to be suspicious of any public institution."<p>


"The idea of holding schools accountable to test scores has its
attractions, fits aspects of the national mood, and adheres to a
long-standing American tradition of turning to standardized testing as the
answer to our ills," she says. "But the trouble is, as we keep relearning
generation after generation, it contradicts what we know about how human
beings learn and what tests can and cannot do. That a standardized
one-size-fits-all test could be invented and imposed by the state, that
teachers could unashamedly teach to such a test, that all kids could
theoretically succeed at this test, and that it could be true to any form
of serious intellectual and/or technical psychometric standards is just
plain undoable. And the idea that such an instrument should define our
necessarily varied and at times conflicting definitions of being well
educated is, worse still, undesirable."<p>


One of the advantages of reviewing books on my own is that I am perfectly
free (as I would not be if I were writing this for a respectable book
review page) to call up the author and pick a fight. I tried this with
Meier. She called me right back from Boston to gleefully slap me around and
help me see the core of her argument.<p>


Essentially, she has higher hopes for schools than I do. I think we need
standards and tests because they are, at worst, a mild annoyance to the
best teachers but essential to keeping an eye on the worst teachers, and
allowing administrators to rush help to trouble spots. Meier thinks--and
she has years of experience with low-income students to prove her
point--that such kids can learn the way graduate students do, in small
seminars, debating key points with learned and enthusiastic teachers and
researching questions of their own choosing. They can be assessed by
independent panels who look at their writings and sit with them for an hour
or so asking questions that need much more of an answer than filling in a
small rectangle on a computer score sheet with a number two pencil.<p>


I think that is a wonderful goal, but that it will take a long time to
produce enough teachers able to teach that way. In the meantime we risk
losing another generation of poor kids if we don't do the best job we can
for them right now. Meier says I am wrong, that we are going to lose them
anyway because the tests are badmeasures of what they have learned and
because, without a major change in the way we teach, the scores are going
to remain low no matter how many resources we pour into our weakest
schools.<p>


Meier admits that she has lost many more battles than she has won in her
long effort to change the direction of American education. She knows her
way of helping those children who most need help is difficult, and she
cannot guarantee that it will work everywhere.<p>


But she has at least as much, if not more, to show for her efforts as
anyone else I know, and she has thankfully not lost her sense of humor in
the process. I asked how she could count on a culture that worships
baseball scores and stock tables and annual reports to shed its yearning
for regular standardized test data from schools.<p>


She said she understood the problem, but thought Americans were capable of
rising above our craving for strict numerical assessment of all things. She
said she understands that weakness because she shares it.<p>


"I like baseball scores," she said. "I like them so much that that may
explain why I have always been a New York Yankees fan. I want to win at
something."<p>
