	<B>New Federal Rating Unfair to Delaware Schools, Many Say</b><p>

By Michele Fuetsch<br>
Delaware News-Journal<br>
August 11, 2003<p>


<I>Though the details of this story are Delaware specific, the themes apply 
to most states.</I><p>

Last year when the federal government released state-by-state lists of 
public schools that failed to meet performance standards under the 
federal No Child Left Behind law, Michigan had more than 1,500.<p>

This year, it has only 216 because its state school board adjusted the 
calculation that determines how each of its schools is rated on adequate 
yearly progress.<p>

But Delaware, credited with having developed particularly high academic 
standards for its public schools during the mid-1990s, has made no such 
adjustment.<p>

That partly explains why at noon today state education officials are 
expected to announce that the majority of the state's 28 high schools 
are on academic review or, worse, academic watch for not making 
sufficient yearly progress.
<p>
Many elementary and middle schools will be in the same situation, 
leaving school officials with a public relations headache as Delaware, 
like other states, adjusts to the realities of No Child Left Behind, the 
federal school reform act of 2001.<p>

Under the new law's complex rating system, every public school in the 
nation eventually will cycle in or out of academic review or academic 
watch, critics predict.<p>

"It's a setup," said Paul G. Carlson, executive director of the Delaware 
Association of School Administrators. "It's going to do what it was 
designed to do, make public schools look bad."<p>

Public school officials here and in other states have said the new law 
is designed to promote charter schools and voucher systems, a charge 
backers deny.<p>

<B>Concentration on 'cells'</B><p>

Most loudly, though, educators are complaining about an elaborate rating 
system that includes state test scores, goals and groupings of students 
by both race and income, represented by what are called cells.<p>

Under the rating system, the larger or more diverse a district or 
school, the greater its chances of falling from a superior or 
commendable school into the academic review or academic watch category. 
Failure in one cell can do that.<p>

A single school can have as many as 37 cells and a district as many as 
45 cells. The test participation rate of Hispanic students, for example, 
is one cell, the participation rate of Asian students another, that of 
African-American students and special education students, two more 
cells. Under the law, each group must have a 95 percent test 
participation rate, which is the easiest part, educators said.<p>

Other cells represent average test scores for each group, Hispanic 
students in reading, for example, then in math, and the scores must 
improve continually until 2014, when 100 percent in each group must meet 
the state standards.<p>

It's an unrealistic, self-defeating goal akin to saying doctors must 
cure 100 percent of their cancer patients, said Milford schools 
Superintendent Robert Smith. The ratings feel like a slap in the face, 
he said.<p>

"Delaware's made incredible progress in the last six years," Smith said. 
"And then to label ourselves like this, it's just disheartening."<p>

Smith said a school labeled commendable in his district last year under 
the state's old rating system will be in academic review this year under 
the new federal rating system.<p>

In the Red Clay Consolidated School District, one school reached 24 of 
its 25 benchmarks under the new rating system but as of today will be on 
the academic watch list for a second year in a row, Superintendent 
Robert Andrzejewski said.<p>

"Where in America is 96 percent a failure?" Andrzejewski asked.<p>

<B>Facing consequences</B><p>

Although the public doesn't see the school ratings until today, each 
school superintendent received his or her district and school ratings 
last month. Before opening day in some schools, depending on the 
severity of their ratings, districts must offer various remedies to 
parents that range from tutoring programs to allowing them to transfer 
their children to another school.<p>

Delaware performed well on the National Assessment of Educational 
Progress, a series of exams overseen by the federal government and known 
as The Nation's Report Card, but under the new ratings, "our schools are 
not going to look too good," Carlson of the school administrators 
association said.<p>

Results for the 2002 Report Card, released several weeks ago, showed 
Delaware fourth- and eighth-graders, the grade levels regularly tested 
by the federal government, leap-frogging over peers in other states. In 
reading, for example, both grade levels made the greatest point gain in 
overall scores in the nation, moving Delaware from the bottom third to 
the top third of states. In writing, fourth-graders posted the 
third-highest results in the country.<p>

And on the SAT-9 tests, the Stanford Achievement Test Version 9, 
embedded in Delaware's annual academic achievement tests, Delaware 
students also scored high relative to national norms. Pointing to such 
results, educators and parents are complaining that the state tests are 
too difficult and cutoff scores for meeting the standards too high, 
especially in eighth- and 10th-grade math.<p>

Math may explain why many of the state's high schools are expected to be 
on the academic review list. Each year since math testing began, fewer 
than 50 percent of 10th-graders have been able to meet the standard.<p>

Because the standards are so high, critics of No Child Left Behind said, 
an inordinate number of schools will be labeled on academic review or 
academic watch. That casts a poor light, they said, on a public school 
system that has made strides in a state that has unusually diverse 
schools and an unusually high number of children in private or parochial 
schools.
<p>
State Secretary of Education Valerie Woodruff last week rejected the 
idea of revising test standards and calculations so the ratings under 
the new law would not make Delaware look bad compared with other states.<p>

"We've taken the first steps in meeting this law and we will continue," 
she said. "I refuse to give up. I just won't do it."
