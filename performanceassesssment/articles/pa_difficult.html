	<B>Analysis of Regents Math Test Is Ordered After Complaints</B><p>

By ABBY GOODNOUGH  <br>
New York Times<br>
June 20, 2003<P>
 
School administrators across New York State are charging
that the Regents exam in mathematics offered this week was
far too difficult, and that a huge number of high school
seniors may be barred from graduating next week because
they failed it. <p>

Though many districts have not finished tabulating their
scores, superintendents, principals and math department
heads are reporting preliminary results that some described
yesterday as "abysmal," "disastrous" and "outrageous." <p>

"Kids have walked out of the exam in tears knowing they are
just not graduating," said one veteran assistant principal
in Brooklyn, adding that officials from other schools had
been deluging him with horror stories about the test. "One
of the comments I got from a colleague is that summer
school is going to be very crowded this year." <p>

School officials are also crying foul about the Regents
physics exam, though that situation is not so dire because
the test is not a graduation requirement. E-mail bulletin
boards for the state's math and physics teachers have been
bombarded with complaints about the exams in recent days. <p>

This is the second straight year that educators have
criticized the physics exam - in fact, a group of
superintendents from Westchester County and Long Island
unsuccessfully sued the State Education Department last
year on the ground that the exam was an inaccurate measure
of skills. But while all agree that the math exam
introduced two years ago, known as Math A, is challenging,
they say the version administered on Tuesday crossed the
line from difficult to impossible. <p>

Bill Hirschen, an Education Department spokesman, said
department officials had heard that "some of the success
rates have been lower," but that the state would not tally
the scores of either test until mid-July, the deadline for
schools to report their results. Mr. Hirschen later called
back to say that because of complaints about the math exam,
the state would ask schools to report their results
immediately. <p>

Meanwhile, Assemblyman Ryan S. Karben, a Rockland County
Democrat, asked Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills
yesterday to immediately investigate what he called "the
aberrantly low pass rates" on the math exam. In a news
release, Mr. Karben said preliminary reports in Rockland
County showed passing rates of 8 percent to 50 percent,
"far below the traditional rates." <p>

The math exam, which became a graduation requirement in
2001, covers algebra and geometry, along with some
theoretical probability and statistics. It has four parts,
including 20 multiple-choice questions and a number of word
problems in which students explain how they arrive at an
answer. <p>

Most students take and pass the exam as sophomores, after a
year-and-a-half-long Math A class, though those who
struggle with math often put it off until senior year. <p>

While many math teachers hailed the new exam as
appropriately rigorous when it was introduced in 1999, some
of those same teachers say the version given this week was
far too difficult, even for the brightest students. <p>

Some said it was short on algebra, which is the primary
focus of the Math A course, and heavy on difficult geometry
questions. Some questions were unnecessarily wordy, they
said, while others had more than one correct answer and
used terms the students had not been taught. Perhaps their
biggest criticism was that the test packed too many tasks
into single questions. <p>

"The failure rate is way out of proportion to what we would
have anticipated on the basis of how our kids did on
previous exams," said William H. Johnson, superintendent of
schools in Rockville Centre, who led the lawsuit against
the physics exam last year. "We don't know what they are
measuring anymore. It's an absolute guessing game." <p>

Dr. Johnson said that only 19 percent of the roughly 95
students who took the math exam this week passed, compared
with 78 percent of the 336 who took it in January. While
most of the students who took the exam this week were
"repeaters" who had failed it at least once before, Dr.
Johnson said he expected that at least half would pass
because they knew what to expect. <p>

Complaints about this week's math and physics exams are the
latest in a series that have plagued the Education
Department since it stiffened graduation requirements in
1996. Students must now pass Regents exams in English,
math, American history, world history and science to
graduate. Educators have complained that the English and
history exams are too easy or scored too leniently. <p>

In 2001-02, 68 percent of students statewide who took the
Math A exam passed it. In New York City, 50.8 percent
passed. Students currently need a score of 55 to pass the
math test, and while the passing score is supposed to rise
to 65 in 2005, the Regents are considering keeping it at
55. <p>

One state education official said the complaints,
especially from suburban educators, were part of a growing
reaction against standardized testing. "They refuse to
teach to the test," the state official said. "They haven't
done well for that reason." <p>

Middle-class and wealthy school districts have actively
protested the rise in make-or-break tests, even urging
their students to boycott them. But urban educators were
just as vehement in their criticism yesterday. Those in New
York City would not speak for attribution, saying that
Chancellor Joel I. Klein's office had instructed them not
to. <p>

Merryl H. Tisch, a member of the State Board of Regents
from Manhattan, said that school officials were jumping to
conclusions. <p>

"We need to get some data in from a variety of schools
before people start to make ad hominem comments about the
process and the tests," Ms. Tisch said. "It is much too
early to determine the reliability and validity of them."
