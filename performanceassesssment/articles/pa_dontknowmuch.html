	<B>Don't know much about history? Here's why:</b><p>

By Jacquelyn Hall<br>
3/20/2004<p>

ARE TODAY'S students knuckleheads when it comes to American history? Is democracy endangered as a result? Pointing to the dismal results of the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress, educational watchdogs across the political spectrum say yes.<p>

As president of the Organization of American Historians, which will hold its national convention in Boston next week, I'm glad to see history education get the attention it deserves. But how useful is it to bash the younger generation for what they don't know?<p>

The current brouhaha over students' poor scores is only the latest round of hand-wringing about "historical illiteracy" and "civic ignorance." The problem is that no one bothers to "think historically" about these test ! results. When we look back at a century of large-scale tests of historical knowledge, we find little difference between today's high school students and their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents.<p>

The reason, says Stanford education professor Sam Wineberg in the current issue of the Oral History Association's Journal of American History, is that the "system is rigged." Testing companies devise multiple-choice questions to guarantee that only a few students do well, a few badly, and most fall in the mediocre range. The National Assessment of Educational Progress is supposed to be different. But, according to Wineberg,
these practices are so entrenched that they affect these results as well.<p>

And yet alarmists continue to use these tests to whip up crises which, they argue, can only be resolved by more standardized tests and rigid state standards mandating what every child should know. We can all agree that students need a core knowledge of American history. But for that knowledge
to stick, it must have some connection to their lives. The real challenge is to use what students do know -- the sense of history they glean from family stories, museums, historic sites, films, and television to engage them in the lifechanging process of learning to "think historically."<p>

Historical thinking involves
analyzing evidence, weighing conflicting
interpretations, discerning
casuality, developing arguments, and
contextualizing the present in
the light of the past. Beyond that,
history is a great human drama,
filled with conflict, contingency,
transcendence and tragedy.<p>

But if most adults remember
history as the most boring subject they
studied in school, they
obviously missed out on both the skills and
the drama. And yet Americans in
record numbers are engaging with
the past as visitor! s to museums
and historic sites, viewers of the
History Channel, and the like.
It is not history that bores them, but
the teaching of history in the
schools.<p>

One problem is obvious: More
than 80 percent of those who are
assigned to teach history at the
middle and high school levels did not
major, or even minor, in
history. Many become creative and effective
history teachers nonetheless.
But we need teachers with a deep
understanding of their subject
matter. Then we need to make sure
they aren't handcuffed by deadly
textbooks and unwieldy, mandatory
standards.<p>

Instead of joining forces with dedicated history
educators to push for such policy-level changes,
too many pundits use "historical illiteracy" to
stoke the culture wars. They claim that college
professors are brainwashing future teachers into
teaching "critical thinking" instead of facts and
ignoring the Founding Fathers in favor of women,blacks, and working people.<p>

In fact, numerous studies show that the vast
majority of teachers still spend too much time
drilling
students on names and dates. Moreover, the problem
is not that K-12 teachers have been
indoctrinated by rogue college professors, but that
most never studied history at all.
<p>
A second problem is the No Child Left Behind Act of
2001, which mandates high-stakes testing in
math and reading but not history. This puts history
educators in a bind. The pressure to "teach to
the test" threatens to squeeze history out of the
curriculum altogether. But nothing could do more
to kill students' interest than adding a history
test that relies on formulaic writing and
memorization. Massachusetts will soon confront this
dilemma, when its US history standards are
incorporated into the statewide MCAS.<p>

The K-12 teachers, students, professors, and public
historians who will gather in Boston will
debate! these issues and more. They will also weave
the stories and narratives that allow us to
make sense of the social world.<p>

The convention theme is "American Revolutions," and
one goal is to use the revolutions in
historical knowledge that have occurred in the past
40 years to enliven the teaching of American
history. A true education requires far more than
prepackaged tests and a box of No. 2 pencils.<p>

American Historians and a fellow at the
