	<B>To Cut Failure Rate, Schools Shed Students</b><p>

By TAMAR LEWIN and JENNIFER MEDINA <br>
New York Times<br>
July 31, 2003<p>


Growing numbers of students - most of them struggling
academically - are being pushed out of New York City's
school system and classified under bureaucratic categories
that hide their failure to graduate. <p>

Officially the city's dropout rate hovers around 20
percent. But critics say that if the students who are
pushed out were included, that number could be 25 to 30
percent. <p>

The city data make it impossible to determine just how many
students are being pushed out, where they are going and
what becomes of them. But experts who have examined the
statistics and administrators of high school equivalency
programs say that the number of "pushouts" seems to be
growing, with students shunted out at ever-younger ages.<p> 

Those students represent the unintended consequence of the
effort to hold schools accountable for raising standards:
As students are being spurred to new levels of academic
achievement and required to pass stringent Regents exams to
get their high school diplomas, many schools are trying to
get rid of those who may tarnish the schools' statistics by
failing to graduate on time. Even though state law gives
students the right to stay in high school until they are
21, many students are being counseled, or even forced, to
leave long before then. <p>

And yesterday, after declining to comment on the issue for
two months, Chancellor Joel I. Klein conceded the point.
"The problem of what's happening to the students is a
tragedy," he said, "It's not just a few instances, it's a
real issue. <p>

"The goal is for students to graduate in four years, but
we've got to stop giving the signal that we're giving up on
students who don't do that. We need more programs for them,
at the same time as we keep up our high expectations for
the system." <p>

Shortly after Mr. Klein's interview, the mayor's office,
too, expressed its sense of urgency about addressing the
pushout problem. <p>

"For any child that's being pushed out, we need to correct
that problem, we need to fix it as soon as possible,"
Deputy Mayor Dennis M. Walcott said. "From the mayor's
office on down, we have to make sure that everyone knows
it's not acceptable to tell children to leave a school
because they've fallen behind. We need schools to offer as
many program options as possible. We're very serious about
this." <p>

At best, the pushouts attend alternative programs leading
to a General Educational Development diploma, which is far
less valuable in the job market and far less likely to lead
to college. But G.E.D. teachers say most of the young
pushouts never earn that certificate. <p>

"It's not a new problem, it's just worse," said Elisa
Hyman, a lawyer with Advocates for Children, an advocacy
group that helps students who have been pushed out gain
reinstatement. "We've had guidance counselors calling on
their cellphones from bathrooms saying they've been told to
get rid of kids." <p>

According to a report by Ms. Hyman's group and the city's
public advocate, using statistics reported to the city by
each high school, the New York City schools discharged more
than 55,000 high school students during the 2000-1 school
year - a number far higher than that year's graduating
class of fewer than 34,000. <p>

Of course, not all of those discharged are pushed out of
the system; many move out of the city, transfer to private
or parochial schools, or drop out of their own accord. But
according to an Education Department breakdown obtained by
The New York Times, 4 out of 10 were categorized as
"transferred to another educational setting," the category
that can hide the pushouts. <p>

Many in that group sought transfers to a different high
school, public or private, in the city. But many others
were pushed into alternative programs at 16, 17 or 18
because they cut classes or failed to accumulate the number
of credits expected for their age. <p>

"There are too many being pushed out and lost," said Betsy
Gotbaum, the city's public advocate. "We need to know where
they are and what's happening to them." <p>

In many ways, Cynthia Boachie is typical of the pushouts.
She was 17 when a counselor told her she could no longer
attend De Witt Clinton High School. She had been in one too
many fights, and missed one too many classes. <p>

Still, it came as a surprise. <p>

"I knew I wasn't the best, but I thought I was doing O.K.," she said. "They just, you
know, didn't care. They said they couldn't help me." <p>


<B>Higher Goals for Schools</B> <p>

New York's pushouts are just now
coming to public attention, in part because of the report
by the public advocate and Ms. Hyman's group, which has
filed suit against the Education Department, accusing
Franklin K. Lane High School in Brooklyn of dumping
hundreds of students in the last three years. <p>

Educators nationwide are waking up to the problem of
pushouts. With the advent of high-stakes testing in dozens
of states, and the fact that under the federal No Child
Left Behind Act, schools with low graduation rates risk
being deemed failing schools, schools are facing real
temptations to make their results look good by getting rid
of low performers. <p>

Just this month, Miami school officials began investigating
a principal who apparently tried to weed out low-performing
students to bolster the school's test scores. And the
Houston schools are mired in controversy after a state
audit found that at some schools, more than half those
discharged should have been classified as dropouts. <p>

In New York, Mr. Klein said, the pushout problem was one he
inherited, and became aware of only late last year. Since
then, he said, he has been investigating the issue, and
making plans for a new accountability system that will,
among other things, keep better track of what happens to
students who leave the system. <p>

Mr. Klein said he was not aware that the discharge issue
had been brought to the department's notice in prior years.<p>


But two years ago, just before he left his post as chief of
assessment and accountability, Robert Tobias recommended an
audit after noticing a "heavy use of the discharge codes"
under which students are no longer accounted for in a
school's graduation rate. <p>

The discharge codes can be misused, he said, by classifying
students who drop out of the system as having left the
city. "It would be possible to inflate graduation rates and
reduce your dropout rate," said Mr. Tobias, who is now an
education professor at New York University. <p>

While the Department of Education classifies each student
who leaves school under one of dozens of codes, it does not
release - or apparently even compile - information on how
many students leave under which circumstances and what
becomes of them. Furthermore, students leaving in similar
circumstances may be classified differently. <p>

The accuracy of accounting for children who leave the
system and the murkiness of the discharge codes, Mr. Tobias
said, "really need some attention if you are going to
tighten up on graduating and dropout rates." <p>

Whatever the flaws of the Education Department data, G.E.D.
providers citywide say it is clear that discharged high
school students are flooding into adult-education programs.<p>


Azi Ellowitch has been teaching for more than a decade in
the equivalency program at the Lehman College Adult
Learning Center, which traditionally catered to low-income
adults and immigrants. <p>


<B>Youths Rush to Sign Up</B> <p>

A few years ago, she began noticing a change in who was
signing up. <p>

"They started coming in for orientation and they were 18 or
19," she said. "We began to have a completely different
conversation." <p>

By last year, Lehman was so inundated with younger students
that it created a supervised study program for those of
high school age. <p>

But most of the young discharged students get no further
than making inquiries or registering for a program. In
fact, Ms. Ellowitch said, three times as many high
school-age students sign up as ever enroll in the program.
And of those who do enroll, about half are two or three
years away from being able to pass, Ms. Ellowitch said. <p>

"These are kids who have gone back and forth, and have
fallen behind," Ms. Ellowitch said. "Schools don't seem to
know what to do with that. Those kids are the least
appropriate for the G.E.D. program. If they need brushing
up, we can certainly help them. But that's not what most of
these kids need. They need years of basic learning." <p>

Cynthia Boachie has been one of Ms. Ellowitch's
hardest-working students since she started the program in
January, and she says she believes she will get her
certificate soon. Ms. Ellowitch, however, said Ms. Boachie
would need at least another year or two of preparation. And
most young students, she said, do not remain in the
program. <p>

To be sure, a few pushouts have strong enough academic
skills to get a quick G.E.D. - but even they often have
regrets about not getting a regular diploma. <p>

Andres Paez, 18, was advised to move on after four years at
John F. Kennedy High School in the Bronx, where, because of
frequent absences, he had accumulated only enough credits
to be considered a sophomore. <p>

"They said you're not making it, and no matter how hard you
work, you're not going to make it, so there's no point in
your trying anymore," Mr. Paez said. <p>

Mr. Paez moved from the huge high school building to the
equivalency class in the red trailer out back - a program
open only to those with relatively good math and reading
skills. Those who get an equivalency diploma in such
programs are counted as graduates of the school, just like
those who get Regents diplomas. <p>

Mr. Paez did well there. He started the class in February
and got his certificate in April. Still, he said, if anyone
had told him that he could have stayed in school longer and
gotten a Regents diploma, he probably would have done so. <p>

"I didn't know you could stay in school until you were 21,"
said Mr. Paez, who is looking for a job. "When they told me
I had to try harder, I did, and my last term I was doing
much better about not cutting. It was awkward when they
said there was no point in trying anymore. I think they
just wanted me out of the school." <p>


<B>Schools Save Face</B> <p>

For high school principals in large schools with discipline
problems, weeding out those who cut class can be a step
toward regaining order. Often, they say, it may be best to
find an alternative for students who are skipping school
and failing classes, rather than letting them linger in
high school. <p>

"These are kids who have had a negative experience in high
school, kids who've had trouble sitting still for class,"
said Marlene Kawalick, Mr. Paez's G.E.D. teacher. "When
they come into G.E.D., I tell them, this is your chance to
put that behind you, to do something productive and move on
with your life." <p>

Good or bad, Mr. Paez now counts as a success in the high
school's statistics. But weaker students, discharged to
community-based equivalency programs, are excluded from the
school's numbers, and not counted against them. <p>

Given the pressure on schools to show good results, it is
understandable that principals would have little interest
in holding on to low-performing students. <p>

"Principals are told these kids who aren't doing well are
going to make your school look terrible," said Don Freeman,
who retired as principal at Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High
School last year. "Sending them into a G.E.D. program is
not a negative, it's not a dropout, it won't count against
you. So more and more of the vulnerable unsophisticated
kids are counseled out to G.E.D. programs." <p>

The pressure for high on-time graduation rates has made
life especially difficult for educators committed to
working with struggling students, people like Vincent
Brevetti, the founding principal of the six-year old
Humanities Preparatory Academy, where more than half the
students are at least a year behind their expected grade. <p>

Mr. Brevetti, who has always taken transfer students and
found that the school has a high success rate with students
who spend five years in high school, said his former
superintendent had explicitly warned him that he should
stop taking transfers and concentrate instead on ninth
graders who would graduate on time. <p>

"He told me, `The days of give me your tired, give me your
poor are over,' " Mr. Brevetti said. <p>

Most students seem to be unaware that they have the right
to stay in school until 21. In interviews with dozens of
discharged students from all over the city, only one
student had heard that she had a legal right to attend
school until 21 - and that was because she overheard her
attendance officer trying unsuccessfully to argue the point
with the guidance counselor who said she had to leave the
school. <p>

Over the last two years, the students being pushed out have
gotten younger. <p>

Community-based adult-education programs say they are now
seeing students as young as 16. In Sunset Park, Brooklyn,
the program at Lutheran Family Services receives more than
250 calls a year from high-school-age students, although
such students are not accepted. <p>

"The kids think the G.E.D. is going to be an easy fix,"
said Martha Kamber, who has run the program for nearly 15
years. "That's what their counselors tell them. I don't
know how you can tell that a 16-year-old isn't going to
graduate, but that's what they tell them." <p>

Two years ago, students under 18 made up about 20 percent
of the 200 students at the Discipleship Outreach Ministries
G.E.D. program in Brooklyn. Today, that number is closer to
40 percent, said Edith Gnanadass, the director of the
program. <p>

The pushout phenomenon, education experts say, exploits a
quirk in the city's statistical reporting: under the city's
system of counting, dropouts count against a school's
results but most discharges do not. <p>

Their exclusion makes the city's statistics look far more
positive. <p>

According to the city's count, in the class that started
ninth grade in the fall of 1998, there were 63,460
students, of whom 51 percent graduated four years later, 20
percent dropped out and 29 percent were still enrolled. <p>

Those are hardly impressive figures, but they would be
substantially worse if they included discharged students,
and counted G.E.D. graduates separately from those who get
a regular high school diploma. <p>

By those lights, slightly less than 40 percent of the class
of 2002 graduated, 19 percent were discharged, 16 percent
dropped out, 2 percent got a G.E.D., and 23 percent were
still enrolled and would need more time to graduate. <p>


<B>A Hole in Record-Keeping</B> <p>


In many ways, discharges are
the black hole of the system's record-keeping. School
administrators are required to explain each student's
departure by assigning one of more than three dozen codes,
indicating, for example, that the student moved out of the
city, enrolled in a vocational program, got a full-time
job, moved into a high school equivalency program or was
expelled after a long-term suspension. <p>

But the codes overlap, and do not paint a clear picture of
what actually becomes of the students. For example, at
William H. Taft High School in the Bronx, 178 students were
discharged with a Code 89 two years ago, meaning that they
were moving to an alternative high school. According to a
breakdown that city education officials compiled in
response to a request by the public advocate, 41 of those
Code 89 students went into "auxiliary services" programs,
which generally lead only to a G.E.D. But in the same
breakdown, an additional 40 students sent to the very same
programs were discharged under a different category, Code
31. <p>

The city does not compile tallies of how many students are
discharged each year under which codes, nor does it provide
information on how many of those discharged are disabled or
immigrants who speak little English. <p>

Instead, it gathers a hodgepodge of information, using a
number of different methodologies, none of which yield
comparable results. And while the city used to compile and
release the reasons for all dropouts and discharges, it no
longer does so. <p>

"I knew it was confusing, but I have been learning the
details just in the last few weeks," Mr. Klein said. <p>

"The information should be out there, and it should be
clear," he said. "You're never going to change the system
unless you're brutally candid." <p>

On June 30, Ms. Gotbaum wrote to Mr. Klein to express
"strong concern" over the high school discharge tracking
system, recounting her office's request last September for
a breakdown of high school discharges, which was
forthcoming only after a nine-month delay - and then
yielded what she said was inadequate information. <p>

At some schools, city statistics show, more students are
discharged each year than graduate or drop out. At Taft,
1,018 students were discharged in 2000-1 - fully 40 percent
of its peak enrollment of 2,493. That tally included the
369 dropouts. Among the students who started ninth grade at
Taft in 1997, 253 had been discharged four years later,
while 157 had dropped out and only 123 graduated. <p>

The numbers are not much better at several of New York's
other large high schools, including Thomas Jefferson in
Brooklyn and Seward Park in Manhattan. <p>

Many more students could graduate, said Jill Chaifetz,
executive director of Advocates for Children, if they were
encouraged to stay and complete the extra work it would
take them to graduate, whatever the time frame. <p>

"Instead of calling kids and saying, `You're not going to
make it so you should leave,' " she said, "it would be a
completely different conversation if you called them in and
said, `You won't be able to graduate in four years, but you
have seven years, so let's talk about a long-term plan that
will give you the enrichment and services you need to help
you get to graduation.' "
