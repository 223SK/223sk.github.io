	<B>Leaders threaten boycott on FCAT</b><br><i>Bush told to reassess the exam and its impact</i><p>

BY CHARLES RABIN<br>
The Miami Herald<br>
May 12, 2003<p>


Dozens of South Florida's community activists and politicians on Sunday threatened a boycott of several major industries if Gov. Jeb Bush doesn't rectify recent FCAT results that could keep thousands of high school seniors, mostly blacks and Hispanics, from graduating.<p>

The targets: the state's tourism, sugar and citrus industries.<p>

The plan: to spend the next 10 days traveling the state and informing communities, then begin a boycott May 22 if Bush doesn't find a way to scale back the numbers of students who may not graduate.<p>

On Sunday, community elders and elected officials, from former Miami City Commissioner Athalie Range to House Minority Whip Frederica Wilson, D-Miami, gathered at a Northwest Miami-Dade church, and signed a letter asking Bush to ``reassess the application and the resulting impact of this exam.''<p>

Then one by one they approached a lectern and explained their views of how unfair the test is to blacks and Hispanics. Some said they believed it was created that way.<p>

''We will not continue to support a government economically that will not educate our children,'' Bishop Victor Curry said.<p>

Last week education officials announced that 13,000 high school seniors statewide, 5,900 in Miami-Dade and Broward, would not graduate because they failed the FCAT.<p>

Additionally, 43,000 third-graders, 11,900 from Miami-Dade and Broward, failed the test, threatening their advancement to the fourth grade.<p>

This is the first year high school seniors and third-graders must pass the test in order to graduate. It's part of a controversial ''A+ Plan'' the governor introduced in 1998 that he said will improve the state's education system, considered one of the worst in the nation.<p>

Speaking Sunday at Curry's New Birth Baptist Church, Wilson directed her anger at the state's top lawmaker.<p>

Wilson said she couldn't understand how the governor could find money for 4,000 new prison beds but not for education or social services.<p>

''I am outraged. I am livid today. I know exactly what this is all about. I am upset with the governor of the state of Florida because he knew from the beginning who was going to pass and who wasn't going to pass,'' Wilson shouted.<p>

``It sounds to me like somebody is being set up. You will not destroy my children. If you do not adjust the FCAT, we are going to boycott this state in a way you've never seen or never heard.''<p>

Bush couldn't be reached for comment Sunday.<p>

<B>HISTORY OF BOYCOTTS</B><p>

For Curry, who initiated Sunday's get-together, it's the most recent in a history of boycott threats over the years. The most famous: an early 1990s boycott of the tourism industry after several city of Miami officials snubbed South African President Nelson Mandela during his visit here.<p>

That boycott proved effective, costing the county millions of dollars, and was instrumental in the creation of Miami Beach's first black-owned hotel.<p>

In 2000, Curry led a group of civil-rights activists who said they would boycott if the county didn't toughen a civilian-oversight panel for police. Nothing came of that.<p>

But with the tourism industry reeling from the recent war and the Sept. 11 attacks, the threat of a boycott is not welcome news to local or tourism officials.<p>

County Manager Steve Shiver said he would rather reserve comment for the governor but said ``obviously it would create some difficulties.''<p>

The release of last weeks FCAT results has also sent local politicians scrambling to come up with solutions.<p>

<B>AN ALTERNATIVE</B><p>

One idea that may be gaining momentum is to offer students who fail the FCAT the chance of admission to a community college if they pass a standard college-entrance exam.<p>

It's a bill Rep. Ralph Arza, R-Miami, got through the House of Representatives unanimously last session, but it didn't clear the Senate.<p>

On Sunday, he said he intends on bringing that same bill back to the legislature.<p>

''These are kids who have met all the high school requirements,'' said Arza, who is a high school teacher. ``That's what gives me a great deal of problem. The fact that we're basing their future on one test.''<p>

Miami-Dade Community College President Eduardo Padrón said letting the students in creates a quandary, as he continues to lobby the state for his underfunded college.<p>

''The problem is if you don't, what would be the future of these kids,'' Padrón said. ``Even with a high school diploma, if you don't get some post-secondary school education you're likely to live in poverty.''<p>

The Rev. Richard Bennett, executive director of the African American Christian Clergy, spoke his mind Sunday.<p>

''My grandfather has suffered wrong. My father has suffered wrong. I've suffered wrong. Now they want our kids to suffer wrong,'' Bennett said. ``We're for real Governor Bush -- and we're coming.''
