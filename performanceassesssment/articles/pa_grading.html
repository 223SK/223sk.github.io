	<B>Grading This Article? First, Take Time to Learn the Rules</b><p>

BY TAMAR LEWIN <br>
New York Times<br>
June 11, 2003<p>


PARSIPPANY, N.J. - We start the morning with a packet of
sample papers, on which students have had 20 minutes to
respond to the statement "The world is getting better all
the time." <p>

There are papers on technology, medical advances, politics,
the birth of a cousin, the destruction of the "o-zone
layer" - and a whole lot on the war in Iraq and the terror
attacks of Sept. 11. Some are two paragraphs, some are more
than two pages. Some offer platitudes, some discuss
literary examples, some are personal narratives. <p>

We silently grade six papers, and the trainer asks us to
raise our hand if we gave a particular paper a 6, a 5, a 4,
etc. <p>

There is stunning unanimity - except for me. <p>

Only a handful of the high school and college teachers
grading the SAT II writing test are even one grade off from
what the trainers assigned when they chose the sample
papers. Most have been scoring such papers for years, and
they know a 6 from a 5, no sweat. <p>

Given 25 years making a living writing for newspapers, I
came in thinking that I, too, would know good writing. I
also came in quite skeptical that readers could be trained
to adhere to objective grading standards on something as
emotionally subjective as writing. <p>

That will soon be a crucial question for millions of high
school students: starting in two years, the two million
college applicants who take the SAT each year will be
required to produce a sample essay. <p>

Although some details, like whether they will have 25 or 30
minutes for the essay, remain to be resolved, it is clear
that the new test will be much like the current SAT II
writing test. And while the College Board, which has used
the Educational Testing Service to score the SAT II, will
use NCS Pearson to grade the new writing test, that
process, too, will be similar. <p>

At my grading session, about 100 teachers from across the
country are being paid $22 an hour to grade the 33,000
essays produced at the May 3 SAT II writing test. Each
essay is read by at least two graders, so over the five
days, each one will be plowing through some 660 essays. <p>

Our instructions don't help me much: Ignore the
handwriting. Read holistically, not analytically. Do not
reread. Read supportively, and grade what's there, not
what's missing. If the paper is absolutely illegible, or
completely off topic, give it to your table leader. Read
the whole thing before making any judgment, since some
papers improve greatly once the student gets going.
Remember these are children, and they had only 20 minutes
to write. And remember, even if this is the 90th paper
you're reading on the war in Iraq or Sept. 11, it's the
first for the writer. <p>

Morning and afternoon, at each grading session, scorers
start with a set of "calibration" essays, to make sure
their judgment is still in tune with the standards. <p>

I give the same bad grades as everybody else. But I am way
off on the good ones. I give a 3 to the paper that the
experienced readers saw as the model of 6-ness. It begins
with the sentence, "The world has taken a turn for the
worst." I am put off by "worst" where it should have said
"worse" - and by the way the writer talks about political
correctness and homogenization, without ever explaining how
they make the world worse. <p>

At my table of seven, the leader, Marilyn Collins,
congratulates the other graders, who have been exactly
right on the samples - except for one man who confesses
that he flipped the 5 and the 6. <p>

"Did you see the error of your ways?" the table leader asks
gently, laughing. <p>

We go through three sets of samples at the initial morning
training. Everyone is impressively in sync. I remain
bewildered. <p>

While the others begin plowing through the piles of tests
in pink folders on each table, I sit down with the trainers
to see if I can discover the error of my ways. <p>

They explain that I should not have been put off by the
first sentence, that it's just a beginning stutter, to be
overlooked. And, they say, what makes it a 6 is the
sophisticated use of language, the organization and the
lively, detailed examples, one about Clear Channel
Communications and how it prevented its radio stations from
broadcasting Rage Against the Machine after the Sept. 11
attacks, and the other about how the New York Regents exams
had been sanitized for political correctness. <p>

They go back over the standards with me: a 6 demonstrates
clear and consistent competence, and is well organized and
fully developed, with a variety of sentence structures, a
range of vocabulary and only occasional errors. A 4 shows
adequate competence, with some errors in grammar or diction
and minimal sentence variety. <p>

We talk about several papers where my assessment was
radically out of line. Generally, I seem to be looking for
some attempt to deliver a full disquisition on whether the
world is getting better, while they are looking for
competent writing that glances at the larger question, even
if only through the characters in "A Streetcar Named
Desire."<p>

What is most helpful to me is a particularly cryptic piece
of advice: "We sometimes say you have to grant the
"is-ness" of the paper," said Dr. Agnes Yamada, an English
professor at California State University, Dominguez Hills. <p>

It works. I return to the ballroom, grade 32 more sample
papers in the next hour, and discover that I have entered
the SAT mind-set, that I am reliably in line with the
standards, varying from the assigned grade on only four
papers, and only by one point. <p>

I now know a 6 from a 5. But I'm not sure this is a good
thing. I have lost all memory of my old criteria for
judging writing, the ones I walked in with. And I have no
idea whether the world is getting better.
