	<B>Exit exam said to harm, not help</B><p>

OAKLAND - California's High School Exit Exam has done little to motivate students or equalize education, but has instead demoralized teens and essentially punished poor and minority students, according to a report released Saturday. <p>

The report by Californians for Justice outlines known disparities among the state's 8,915 public schools and argues that unequal learning opportunities are a barrier for those who live in high-poverty, high-minority neighborhoods where school resources are fewer. Californians for Justice is a statewide grass-roots public policy organization. <p>

Poor and minority students and those still learning English are far more likely to attend schools with fewer college-prep classes, more underqualified teachers and more environmental problems such as dirty bathrooms or moldy classrooms, the report said. <p>

Those students are more likely to fail the exit exam as well. <p>

Among the class of 2004, just 34 percent of Latino students, 31 percent of African-American students and 27 percent of English-learner students have passed the math portion of the exam. White and Asian-American students have passed by 69 percent and 78 percent, respectively. <p>

On the English section of the test, about 60 percent of Latino and black students and 43 percent of English learners have passed. Again, white and Asian-American students had far higher pass rates, with 85 percent of whites and 82 percent of Asian-Americans successfully completing the section. <p>

At a community speakout Saturday in Oakland, Californians for Justice joined students and teachers in calling on lawmakers to fix California's schools before administrators withhold diplomas from those who fail the test. <p>

"What the state needs to know is this isn't about whether students are or are not trying," said Emily Hobson, the report's author. "The scores reflect the inequality in the schools." <p>

The exit exam has become one of the most feared tests for students planning to graduate in 2004 and beyond, when the exam's diploma penalty is scheduled to kick in. <p>

State-level educators say the exam was created to improve student achievement and ensure graduating seniors are competent in core areas such as reading, writing and math. <p>

"The exit exam is leaving not only our children behind, but our future," said Monique Chapman, a Fremont parent who sued the state claiming the exam discriminates against students with learning disabilities. The suit has since gained class-action status. <p>

Sergio Morales of C-Beyond, a Concord youth organization, said the thought of not passing the exit exam, and not going to college, is a tremendous burden for students. <p>

"Students are angry," he said. "They're frustrated and they're scared. They're scared there's a test that measures their ability to go to college or not." 
<p>
A state-commissioned analysis of the exit exam found the test has spurred high school teachers to better teach state content standards. But the review also found classroom instruction "has not been effective" for all students. <p>

Californians for Justice is calling on the state Board of Education to delay the diploma penalty, but contends that a short postponement is not enough. 
<p>
"We oppose a delay for delay's sake, a delay that is so short that it provides no time for the creation of real opportunities to teach and learn," the report's authors wrote. 
<p>
The state board is expected to decide in July if it will postpone the exam penalty.
