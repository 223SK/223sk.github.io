	<B>Moving Quickly Through History</b><p>

BY MICHAEL WINERIP  <br>
New York Times<br>
June 18, 2003<p>


TODAY, more than 100,000 New York high school students will
take the state global history exam. Richard P. Mills, the
state education commissioner, has such faith in this test -
and the state tests in English, math, American history and
science - that in recent years, he has made passage of all
five exams mandatory for a high school diploma. <p>

New York now has one of the most test-driven education
systems in the nation. For global history teachers like
Dalia Hochman at La Guardia High School in Manhattan, it's
a whirlwind tour through the centuries as she tries to
cover everything on the state test. "In one stretch," Ms.
Hochman said, "we do the scientific revolution, French
Revolution, revolution in Haiti, Simón Bolívar and Latin
American independence movements, the Napoleonic period,
19th-century nationalism in Italy and Germany, Zionism,
back to the Industrial Revolution - it's a race to finish."<p>


Nor does the state commissioner take kindly to high schools
that want to teach history differently or test students'
knowledge in other ways. Two dozen schools in the state use
the International Baccalaureate, a curriculum that teaches
history by emphasizing a more in-depth look at fewer eras,
requires students to do research with primary sources and
uses international specialists to grade the work. The
program is considered so rigorous that students often
accumulate enough credits to skip their freshman year of
college. But it's not good enough for Dr. Mills. He has
refused to approve the International Baccalaureate history
program as an alternative to state tests. <p>

Dr. Mills has also rejected a request by a consortium of 32
small high schools, including Urban Academy in Manhattan,
to assess their students' history research and oral
presentations by using real historians - like Eric Foner of
Columbia University and Mikal Muharrar of the New-York
Historical Society - instead of state tests. Urban Academy
may be a national model for small, successful high schools,
featured most recently in Newsweek magazine; it may take
minority children who have failed at other New York City
high schools and get virtually all of them into four-year
colleges. But that is not good enough for Dr. Mills. <p>

So Ann Cook, co-director of Urban Academy, wondered: Since
the state is so dismissive of other assessment approaches,
just how good are the state's own tests? Using a Gates
Foundation grant, Ms. Cook assembled several panels of
specialists to critique the New York State Regents exams. <p>

In global history, the panelists, mainly history
professors, actually took recent state tests. They were
struck by the gap between how rigorous state standards
sound (students must "evaluate evidence," "probe ideas and
assumptions," "ask and answer analytical questions") and
how "vapid" the test essay questions were. <p>

The state uses a document-based question, an excellent
testing exercise, panelists agreed. Students write an essay
based on excerpts from several historical documents. Two of
the panelists - Carol Berkin, a history professor at Baruch
College, and William Everdell, dean of humanities at St.
Ann's School in Brooklyn - have created document-based
questions for the College Board Advance Placement test and
they correct AP history essays. They thought the state
document-based question essay was hopelessly broad, the
documents weak and misleading. <p>

A recent AP world history document-based question asked
students to discuss the fall of slavery and rise of
indentured servitude in the 19th and 20th centuries. The
nine documents (spanning 1850-1920) included a newspaper
editorial, photographs of indentured laborers on a sugar
plantation, an indentured labor contract and a laborer's
written protest about the number of hours worked. <p>

A recent state global history document-based question said,
"Compare and contrast the role of women in different
societies throughout history." The seven documents
(spanning 202 B.C. to 1980) were mostly quotations about
women, often with no context of who the speaker was -
aristocrat or peasant, revolutionary or reactionary. Fred
Smoler, a professor at Sarah Lawrence College, called them
"pseudo documents, tiny little fragments, small paragraphs"
and a "grotesque distortion" of what a document-based
question should be. One document, a day in the life of a
rural Sierra Leone woman (5 a.m. carry water and firewood;
6 a.m. light fire, heat water) was undated, and it was
impossible to tell if it was hundreds of years old or
modern. The state answer key said students could presume it
was any date they wanted it to be, and panelists said this
was the worst, the antithesis of what you wanted to teach
students about historical research. "The panel was
generally appalled," the members' report said. <p>

As for the multiple choice section, while several
panelists, including Barbara Winslow, a Brooklyn College
professor, thought 2 to 3 questions of each group of 50 had
more than one right answer, they were more concerned about
a test that ranged from the rise of the hominid to the
North American Free Trade Agreement. "My heart goes out to
anyone teaching to this test," Professor Smoler said. "I'm
not sure how you could do it." <p>

State education officials defend the test. Tom Dunn, a
spokesman, said, "We did not hear negative feedback from
teachers in the schools." <p>

Ms. Hochman of La Guardia High, a 2000 Yale graduate in
history, spent a recent weekend writing comments on 170
term papers that examined an international response to a
world problem - like AIDS in Uganda. The papers were
brilliant and deep, she says, but it bothers her that they
are not part of the state evaluation of her students or her
school. Though she loves their lively classroom
discussions, she feels constant pressure to cut it off, to
keep up with a test-driven curriculum that, she believes,
goes a mile wide and an inch deep. After Sept. 11, 2001,
her students begged for special lessons on Islam. But at a
Regents training conference, she said, a veteran mentor
teacher warned her, "Honey, spend two days on the Byzantine
Empire and three days on Islam, and then you've got to move
on." <p>

And though she has bright students (virtually all pass the
state test) so much is crammed in, Ms. Hochman says, "it's
unbelievable how little they remember a year later."
Several sophomores she had for global history are now
juniors in her American history class. "When we got to
World War I, they said, `Is that the one with Mussolini?' "
