	<B>Critics Say Regents English Tests Push Immigrants to Drop Out</B><p>

By Jennifer Medina<br>
New York Times<br>
June 23, 2002<p>

Regents tests that were meant to encourage high statewide
standards are so frustrating to students who are not fluent
in English that a third of them are dropping out of high
school, according to two groups that advocate for immigrant
children. <p>

Leaders of the groups - the New York Immigration Coalition
and Advocates for Children - said in a joint report that it
was unfair to expect students who had recently learned
English to pass the same tests as students who have been in
American schools since kindergarten. <p>

The leaders said that more resources should be devoted to
students who are learning English and that exams should be
especially tailored for them. These students make up about
14 percent of the high school population of 280,000, and
their numbers are expected to increase with continued
immigration. <p>

More than 31 percent of the students classified as English
language learners who were supposed to graduate in June
2001 dropped out along the way. The dropout rate has
increased sharply since the Regents requirement was enacted
in 1999. Of those English learners who were supposed to
graduate in 1998, about 17 percent dropped out, according
to the Board of Education. <p>

"There are students who have colleges waiting for them, but
they can't get out of high school because they cannot pass
the English Regents," said Margie McHugh, executive
director of the Immigration Coalition. <p>

The Manhattan Comprehensive principal, Howard A. Friedman,
said that at least half of the students at the school could
pass all the tests except English. "If a student is coming
in at 18 or 19, even with excellent instruction they will
not be able to do as well as a student who has been in
English classes their entire lives," Mr. Friedman said. <p>

The Regents English requirement was first put into effect
for the class of 2000, with math added for the class of
2001. For this year's class, United States history and
global studies were also required. By 2005, all high school
students must pass those tests and one in science. <p>

In the report, which was released last week, the groups
called for increased incentives to ease a shortage of 3,600
certified bilingual teachers in the next three years, and
for more extended day and Saturday programs for students
learning English. <p>

Another cause of frustration for immigrant students,
several students and parents said, is that they were turned
away by officials at some schools who told them they were
too old. <p>

Dr. Edna Vega, superintendent of the Office of English
Language Learners, said students who wished to finish high
school were never turned away. But she added that a student
who is over 17 and has had a break in formal education is
referred to schools that specialize in older students, like
Manhattan Comprehensive.
