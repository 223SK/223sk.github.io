	<B>L.A. School Board Votes to Oppose State Exit Exam</B><br><i>Opponents of the high school graduation requirement hope the action will persuade California to drop or delay the test.</i><p>

The Los Angeles Unified School Board voted unanimously Tuesday to oppose the
state's requirement that students pass an exit exam before graduating from
high school, a move that some educators hope will influence the state to
postpone or drop the test.<p>

"We should be working with the State Board of Education so that this whole
thing gets stopped," said board member Genethia Hudley-Hayes, who
co-sponsored the motion with board member Jose Huizar.<p>

"If we use the California Exit Exam to determine whether or not a student
receives a diploma, and yet we're not giving youngsters what they need to
pass, then we're holding students accountable for something that we're not
holding the institution accountable for," she said.<p>

More than 100,000 teenagers have failed the California High School Exit Exam
at least twice and must retake it.<p>

Students across the state have held rallies and protests in recent months to
urge to state to delay or drop the graduation requirement, which takes
effect for the class of 2004.<p>

At one point during Tuesday's meeting, Hudley-Hayes suggested that the Los
Angeles district simply boycott the test. However, after conferring in
closed session with attorneys and other board members, she withdrew that
idea. As a public official, she said, "It's not OK for me to break the law."<p>

Nearly 100 students, mostly members of the Coalition for Educational
Justice, a grass-roots organization that has been fighting the exam, showed
up at Tuesday's meeting and cited disparities among ethnic groups on test
results.<p>

Pass rates on the 2002 exit exam among white and Asian students were nearly
double those of Latinos and African Americans. Among students from
low-income homes, only 22% passed the exam's math section last spring, while
about 40% of students considered not economically disadvantaged passed.<p>

The school board's vote was "a big victory for people who are trying to
challenge institutional racism in schools," said Alex Caputo-Pearl, a member
of the group and teacher at Crenshaw High School.<p>

"It means that L.A. Unified, the biggest and most influential district in
the state, is now on record opposing the racist diploma penalty that is
attached to the high school exit exam," Caputo-Pearl said.<p>

Members of the State Board of Education have said that they will re-examine
whether to delay the requirement or change it over the next few months.<p>

Test supporters warned that dropping the test would not help struggling
students in the long run because the exam's content is not unreasonably
difficult and that students can get help to master the material they should
know by graduation.<p>

The exam covers language arts concepts through the 10th grade and math
through basic algebra, often a ninth-grade class.<p>

However, the exam protesters contend that some schools are not teaching the
material on the test, which is offered as many as three times a year.<p>

Rene Martinez, 16, a junior at Roosevelt High School in East Los Angeles,
said the test is unfair because he has received an inadequate education.<p>

He said classes are overcrowded, teachers are unprepared and it is a
challenge to learn.<p>

Still, he is coping with the possibility that he may not graduate next year,
although he wants to attend Pitzer College.<p>

"It makes me feel dumb," he said. "It makes me feel like I should know all
of this stuff, but I don't."
