Regent Anthony Bottar<br>
120 Madison Street, Suite 1600<br>
MONY Tower II<br>
Syracuse, NY 13202<br>

February 26, 2005 <p>

Dear Regent Bottar: <p>

As professional historians who value historical instruction and learning at every stage of education, we welcome the current lively debate over rigorous standards, especially because our own work at the university level is inevitably affected by how history is taught in high school classrooms.  
<p>
We write, however, to express our deep concern regarding the impact that the current policy of “high-stakes” testing in social studies is having on the effective teaching of history and the preparation of students for the study of history at the college level.  
<p>
While gearing teaching to a mandated test may be desirable in many educational settings, experience has taught us that the use of such testing as a primary assessment tool constrains curriculum and classroom practice because it de-emphasizes the analytical reading, writing, and thinking abilities required by the discipline. We find that students and teachers girding for such tests too often proceed rapidly and superficially through a chronology utilizing a single text and examining primary source documents via rote, predetermined questions. When this occurs, students may not learn to make informed judgments central to the interpretation and understanding of history.  
<p>
While we understand that some New York schools are working to cultivate these skills within the conventional framework developed by the state, we greatly admire the effort by others who have developed alternative methods of teaching history -- methods that stress depth, the use of multiple sources, and the ability of students to articulate and refine their own perspectives through a rigorous analysis of historical evidence.  
<p>
Moreover, because we have met and worked with high school teachers whose knowledge, love of history, and commitment enable them to work along these lines, we would strongly recommend the adoption of a system flexible enough to accommodate such an approach. Present arrangements do not permit such flexibility.  
<p>
A structure that allows alternative teaching and assessment mechanisms to operate without undue constraints has the potential to greatly enhance instruction at the high school level, strengthen collaboration between secondary and college educators, and draw more dedicated historians into the ranks of high school teachers. We urge you to ensure that this sort of teaching is able to continue, so that students can be prepared for college level work in the ways most appropriate to their background, talents, and interests. We would be willing to work with you to achieve this goal.  
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
