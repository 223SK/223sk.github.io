	<B>Math Failures Are Raising Concerns About Curriculum</B><p>

By KAREN W. ARENSON   <br>
New York Times<br>
July 2, 2003<P>
 
Everyone knows now that the June 17 Math A Regents exam was
problematic, with almost two out of three test-takers
failing. <p>

The question is why. <p>

Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner,
nullified the test results last week for juniors and
seniors, and he and the Regents will soon appoint a panel
of experts to figure out what went wrong. In the meantime,
parents, teachers and others have their own theories. <p>

Some of their explanations have to do with the mechanics of
the test: poorly worded questions, lengthy questions that
required students to be good readers, multiple-choice
questions that had more than one valid answer. Some
educators say they were the sort of problems that could
have been caught by closer scrutiny of the test before it
went out. <p>

"If someone had paid me $100 to proof this test, I could
have picked out the problems that would create problems,"
said Daniel Jaye, chairman of the math department at
Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. <p>

But some explanations touch on deeper issues, including
whether the Math A curriculum is too broad, how much harder
it is for students to solve problems than to manipulate
equations, and whether unqualified teachers are even less
likely to succeed in preparing students than they were with
the old math curriculum. <p>

When the Math A exam was introduced in 1999, the State
Education Department proudly declared that it was harder
than Math 1, the old first-level test. There would be more
word problems, and students would need a deeper
understanding of math and math concepts to do well. Instead
of covering a year's worth of material, as most Regents
exams do, Math A was meant to be learned over three
semesters. Although some students complete the work in a
year, some schools have added extra instruction periods and
tutoring sessions, and have stretched the course out over
four semesters. <p>

For a while, the state offered both the old Math 1 exam and
the new Math A test. Some schools moved their students
quickly to Math A, while others dragged out the transition.
The Math 1 test was given for the last time in January
2002. <p>

Alan Ray, a spokesman for the Education Department, said
that the scores on Math A had gradually improved. In June
2002, 86,000 students took the test, and the passing rate
was 61 percent. The department does not yet know how many
students took the test last month, but a preliminary survey
suggests that only 37 percent of the students passed. <p>

The shift from rote learning to a greater emphasis on
mastery of concepts is welcomed by some college professors
in math and science, who have been trying to accomplish the
same shift. They say that although mastery of some facts is
critical, students who focus on memorization may do well in
a course but remember little of it six months later. <p>

"Many of the students are coming from an environment where
the tests are pretty much about facts, not about how to
puzzle something out, or whether the data you have been
given makes sense," said Robert B. Suter, a biologist at
Vassar College. "It takes students coming in a while to
learn that they are in a somewhat different ballgame." <p>

But high school math teachers in New York say that the
shift in the state math curriculum has not been smooth, and
that schools, teachers and students could not keep up with
the changes. <p>

"There has to be a balance between skills and concepts,"
said Mr. Jaye at Stuyvesant. "But the weight shifted a
little too quickly for us to keep equilibrium here, and
collectively we capsized. <p>

"I'm not a champion of the old Regents, which was cookie
cutter - all skills. If you studied the three previous
exams, there would be no surprises. But in the effort not
to make Math A cookie cutter, the kids got flamed." <p>

Part of the problem, he and others said, is that the
curriculum expanded and expanded, and nothing was taken
away. Many teachers felt that they were racing through
material without giving students the time they needed to
master it. <p>

"One of the big problems is that the curriculum is so broad
that you cannot go very deep," said Bob Hazen, president of
the Association of Mathematics Teachers of New York State. <p>

"It used to be with the old Math 1, 2 and 3 tests that you
could just bone up on old tests and pass them and not have
a firm grasp of the concepts," Mr. Hazen said. "But now you
are looking at a standards-based assessment, and it is very
difficult to look at the past tests and know what will be
on the next test." <p>

Some educators say teaching students to be problem solvers
takes more skill on the part of teachers, a challenge when
there is a shortage of qualified math teachers. <p>

"Teachers are not really prepared to prepare kids for this
test properly," said Alfred S. Posamentier, dean of the
School of Education, City College of New York, and the
author of books on problem solving. "There is very little
training for teachers in problem solving; it's assumed they
will get it along the way." <p>

Commissioner Mills said he stood by the Math A curriculum.<p>


"There are a great many people who say we should just teach
students how to balance a checkbook," he said. "But that is
a level of math that is learned by the fourth grade. Are we
ready to say that the most minimal level is all students
need?" <p>

"The Regents made the fundamental policy choice here, and I
support it," he added. "The standards represent a level of
knowledge and skill that's essential for every child." <p>
