	<B>The Changes Unwelcome, a Model Teacher Moves On</B><p>

By MICHAEL WINERIP  <br>
New York Times<br>
May 28, 2003<P>
 
ORLANDO, Fla. <p>

MS. MacLEISH! Ms. MacLeish!" The door to Room 7 was still
locked, but the kindergartners could not wait for the
school day to begin. They were jumping up and down in the
hallway, trying to peek through the high window and get Ms.
MacLeish to let them in early. <p>

From inside Room 7, Laurin MacLeish could see the tops of
blond ponytails and brown cornrows bouncing in and out of
view. She could hear the jiggling of the locked doorknob.
At 8:25 precisely, with the first bell, she opened up. <p>

"Ms. MacLeish, I found a roly-poly!" shouted Victoria
Sibons. <p>

"Ms. MacLeish, I caught a caterpillar!" yelled Marcus
Maxwell. <p>

"Ms. MacLeish, Marcus didn't catch that caterpillar!" said
Ashley Ann Duncan. "This girl gave it to Marcus." Ms.
MacLeish did not care; she told Mighty Marcus Maxwell that
she had never seen a more perfect caterpillar, and, along
with the roly-poly, it went right into the Room 7
terrarium. <p>

"Precious darlings, we have a day that's bigger than big,"
said Ms. MacLeish. "I need attentive listeners." She
explained that she had just gotten back the annual
kindergarten highlights video she compiles each year.
"Guess what I did when I saw it for the first time last
night?" <p>

"You cried!" they all shouted. <p>

"Oh, yes," said Ms. MacLeish. "And what color were my
tears, boys and girls? Pink or blue?" <p>

"Pink!" (Happy tears.) <p>

"Of course," said Ms. MacLeish.<p>

"To see how much you've grown and how we've come all the
way to the merry month of May." Ms. MacLeish has been
teaching kindergarten 32 years, and still this growing-up
business never ceases to amaze her. When they start in
August, their self-portraits have arms coming out of their
ears, and by May they have necks, bellies, even lips. <p>

Through it all, no one has a better time than Ms. MacLeish.
In the video highlights, the person with the biggest smile
at the field trip to the zoo, at the Halloween party ("Look
at Ms. MacLeish! She's a butterfly!"), at the
100th-day-of-school celebration, is Ms. MacLeish. <p>

When Lizzy Volcey raced in late, meaning everyone was now
present, Ms. MacLeish was the first to break into a chorus
of "Everyone Is Here Today" ("Let's give a hip hip
hooray!"). <p>

Being in Ms. MacLeish's class is like living in a Broadway
musical where people walking down the street routinely
burst into song. Ethel Merman would have seemed normal in
Room 7. If someone wears new shoes, they sing the New Shoe
song. "Would you rather read this or sing it?" Ms. MacLeish
asked, pointing to the board, and - with Ms. MacLeish
leading on the autoharp - the children burst out singing "K
Is for Kindergarten Hip Hip Hooray." <p>

"You are the b-e-s-t - kiss your brains for being so
smart," said Ms. MacLeish, whose great gift is creating so
much fun that children forget they are learning. At one
point, Ashley Ann looked up and complained, "It's going by
way too fast." Indeed, Ms. MacLeish, of Lake Silver
Elementary, has such magic that in 1998 she was named
Orange County teacher of the year. <p>

And so it is easy to imagine all the broken hearts this
spring when Ms. MacLeish, 53, sent a letter home saying
this would be her last year teaching kindergarten. It was
no ordinary goodbye letter. Ms. MacLeish was m-a-d. Her
tears were not pink. She fears that the kindergarten world
she knows and has raised to a fine art is being destroyed.
"A single high-stakes test score is now measuring Florida's
children, leaving little time to devote to their character
or potential or talents or depth of knowledge," she wrote.
"Kindergarten teachers throughout the state have replaced
valued learning centers (home center, art center, blocks,
dramatic play) with paper and pencil tasks, dittos,
coloring sheets, scripted lessons, workbook pages." <p>

The breaking point for Ms. MacLeish was an article in the
paper praising a kindergarten teacher who had eliminated
her play centers and was doing reading drills, all part of
a push to help her school get a higher grade on the annual
state report card. <p>

It's not that Ms. MacLeish is anti-academic. Please. Her
room is crammed with books. Every morning the children
print their first and last names on the attendance sheet.
Sundays, Ms. MacLeish visits bookstores, and her room
features baskets of books by her favorite authors. (The
Robert Munsch basket includes a photo of the author meeting
Ms. MacLeish, who is, of course, beaming.) <p>

Ms. MacLeish knows she's been lucky to have a principal,
Stephen Leggett, who hates the state testing as much as she
does and has done his best to insulate his teachers. But
she's never seen so much state and federal intrusion into
the classroom and can watch the testing moving her way. The
fourth-grade test used to be the big deal for Florida
school report cards. Now it is the third-grade test, used
to determine retention. This year, for the first time, Ms.
MacLeish had to spend two days giving state tests to
kindergartners to establish base-line scores. "The wolf is
at the door," she said. "I must get out before it gets me."<p>


After 32 years, this single woman, who may be the best
kindergarten teacher in Florida, makes $51,000. She is not
retiring. Instead, she'll be a resource support teacher.
This way, she said, she'll have children for 90 minutes at
most and won't feel so responsible for their future. <p>

The last week of school, Ms. MacLeish was feted at every
turn. Tuesday, at the class play, her kindergartners each
handed her a rose with baby's breath, and Orlando's mayor,
Buddy Dyer, proclaimed Laurin MacLeish Day. (His son Drew
was in Ms. MacLeish's class two years ago.) <p>

Friday the kindergartners got to visit Ms. MacLeish's
house, a stunning moment for those who had assumed she
lived in Room 7. They walked the half-mile from the school.
When a dog barked, they sang. ("I know a dog. His name is
Wags.") When they saw a house with an American flag, they
stopped to recite the pledge. At Ms. MacLeish's, they
played with her toys. <p>

It was 6 p.m. on the last day by the time she turned off
the light in Room 7. What a run, what a week, a thousand
tears, pink and blue. She'd miss them, every one - she
always did - but she was relieved too. To the end, Ms.
MacLeish gave her all. (Never let her standards fall.)
