	<B>More Youths Opt for G.E.D., Skirting High-School Hurdle</b><p>

By KAREN W. ARENSON <br>
May 15, 2004<p>


A testing system created more than half a century ago to
help World War II veterans earn the equivalent of a high
school diploma has increasingly become a way for teenagers
to short-circuit high school. 
<p>
Roughly one of every seven high school diplomas granted in
the United States in recent years has gone to someone who
has passed the tests, known as the G.E.D. And the
proportion of school-age students taking that route has
risen sharply. 
<p>
Nationally, teenagers accounted for 49 percent of those
earning G.E.D.'s in 2002, up from 33 percent a decade
earlier. Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York were
among the states where teenagers accounted for more than
half of those earning G.E.D.'s. in 2002. 
<p>
"The proportion of teenagers getting G.E.D.'s has doubled
since 1989, while overall high school graduation rates have
declined slightly," said Duncan Chaplin, an economist at
the Urban Institute in Washington. 
<p>
The growth has been especially pronounced in New York City.
Last year, more than 37,000 school-age students were in
G.E.D. programs run by the school system, up from 25,500
two years earlier. 
<p>
Most educators view the G.E.D. as a valuable option for
people who do not make it through high school, but they do
not consider it equivalent. 
<p>
"The G.E.D. was intended to be a second chance for adults;
it was never intended to replace a high school education,"
said Anita Caref, director of the adult literacy program at
Brooklyn College. 
<p>
Experts attribute the flood of young people in part to the
difficulty in finding a decent job without a high school
diploma, and in part to the increased difficulty of earning
a traditional high school diploma in many states. New York,
for example, has made passing five Regents exams a
condition of graduation, and no longer offers a lesser
diploma for weaker students. 
<p>
Under the federal No Child Left Behind law and state
efforts to hold schools more accountable, schools have more
incentive to discourage weak students from staying.
Students who transfer to G.E.D. programs are usually off
school rolls, but in many states are not counted as
dropouts. 
<p>
Mr. Chaplin, of the Urban Institute, said he had "found
pretty strong evidence that the G.E.D. option has been
encouraging kids to drop out of high schools nationwide." 
<p>
"The rules governing the G.E.D. have become more lenient
over time," he said. "Under No Child Left Behind, we're
holding schools very strictly accountable for test scores,
but barely holding them accountable for students who drop
out or go into G.E.D. programs. It is like holding
hospitals accountable for the condition of patients who
leave, but ignoring the number who die. It's a perverse
incentive system." 
<p>
Strictly speaking, the G.E.D. is not an educational program
but a set of five tests requiring more than seven hours and
covering reading, writing, mathematics, social studies and
science. 
<p>
As with the College Board's SAT exams, students are not
required to enroll in any classes before taking the tests,
officially the Tests of General Educational Development,
which are administered by the American Council on Education
in Washington. But many students need help to pass the
G.E.D., and a patchwork of programs has evolved to assist
them, run not only by school districts but also by
community organizations, universities and proprietary
schools. 
<p>
"There seems to be a whole shadow system of schools," said
Elisa Hyman, deputy director of Advocates for Children,
which has charged New York City high schools with pushing
their weakest students into G.E.D. programs without proper
counseling. "Thousands of kids are participating in this
alternative diploma track that is clearly inferior to a
regular diploma." 
<p>
There are no counts of how many students are in G.E.D.
programs nationwide, but G.E.D. directors say that their
programs are overflowing and that the number of young
people has shot up. 
<p>
One sign of the increase is reflected in the number of
young people who take the tests or pass them, although they
represent only a portion of the young people in G.E.D.
programs. In 2001, about 2.8 million students earned
traditional high school diplomas, while about 648,000
G.E.D.'s were awarded, including 266,000 to teenagers. 
<p>
With the introduction of a new, harder test in 2002, the
number of G.E.D.'s fell to 330,000. But Joan Chikos
Auchter, executive director of the G.E.D. Testing Service,
and others predict that the numbers will bounce back. 
<p>
G.E.D. preparation programs vary. Typically, classes are
only a couple of hours a day, sometimes just two or three
days a week. Often there is no standard curriculum, and
there are no state licensing requirements for teachers.
Many classes focus on the types of problems the students
will encounter on the exam. 
<p>
At the Jamaica Learning Center in Queens, one of the first
things Arnold Smith does when he arrives at his classroom
is to post fractured sentences, full of grammar, spelling
and punctuation errors like the ones students will have to
spot and correct on the G.E.D. 
<p>
One morning in February, Mr. Smith's students were focused
on this sentence: "Excited and anxious, the gift's was
quickly unwrapped." 
<p>
"This is a hard one," Mr. Smith said. 
<p>
A student
responded, "No it ain't." 
<p>
But it took some hints before the students could identify
all the errors. 
<p>
The students were mostly attentive. The pace was quick. And
Mr. Smith was nonjudgmental and encouraging. 
<p>
One student later praised Mr. Smith's method, saying: "Now
I get it. I never got it before." 
<p>
The Jamaica center sends about 300 students a year to take
the tests, and about 80 percent pass. But hundreds more are
not close to taking the test, and many drop out. Some are
in basic literacy classes because they read below
sixth-grade level. Some are in pre-G.E.D. classes, where
the reading level is grades seven to nine. Only those
reading at a 10th-grade level or above are put in the
actual G.E.D. classes. 
<p>
G.E.D. administrators say the teenage students bring
problems that adult students do not have. 
<p>
"Not only do the younger students arrive with academic
deficiencies," said Carlo Baldi, director of the Adult
Literacy Program at the City College of New York, "but they
often come in with pretty serious deficiencies in life
skills, too. Things like attendance, responsibility,
maintaining communications." 
<p>
Still, Mr. Baldi and others are reluctant to turn young
students away. 
<p>
"A high school diploma is a very important currency," said
Leslee Oppenheim," director of curriculum and instruction
at the City University of New York. "This opens all kinds
of doors." 
<p>
Even students who obtain a G.E.D., however, are not home
free. They typically earn less than high school graduates,
and are less likely to go to college. The Army limits
G.E.D.-holders to no more than 5 percent of its enlistees,
and they do not qualify for the same enlistment options,
said S. Douglas Smith, a spokesman for the Army Recruiting
Command. 
<p>
But to many struggling high school students, the issue is
not so much the future as the unhappy present. 
<p>
Some students choose the G.E.D. on their own; others,
struggling academically, are told by school officials that
they would be better off in a G.E.D. program. Recent
immigrants with weak English are frequently discouraged
from enrolling in high school and pointed toward G.E.D.
programs. 
<p>
In one recent study, John W. Sipple of Cornell University
and David H. Monk and Kieran Killeen of Pennsylvania State
University "found evidence that teachers advise students of
the G.E.D. option as early as eighth grade." Dr. Sipple
declined to name any schools. 
<p>
Many students say they know that the G.E.D. is viewed as a
lesser degree, but that the atmosphere in G.E.D. programs
is preferable to what they face in high school. 
<p>
"High school isn't for everybody," said Abdullah
Aminnullah, the 17-year-old son of Afghan immigrants, who
entered the Jamaica Learning Center last winter. "You don't
get as much attention in high school as here," he said,
adding, "The teachers here really care and pay attention to
you, and they really teach." 
<p>
Mr. Aminnullah, who said he kept getting into scrapes and
was suspended, said he chose the G.E.D. after learning that
he had accumulated few credits toward graduation. But he
had no problem passing the G.E.D. almost immediately. 
<p>
His classmate Priscilla Catapano also saw the G.E.D. as a
lifesaver. She enrolled at the Jamaica Learning Center last
November, three months after her 17th birthday, when she
realized that she could not graduate with her class. 
<p>
She had cut classes in ninth grade - "It was stupid," she
says now - and missed more classes later because of medical
problems. She could not bear to be left behind, and passed
the G.E.D. this spring. 
<p>
"If you are just getting a job, you are not going to get
the best job with a G.E.D.," Ms. Catapano said. She added:
"I figured that once you are in college, who cares whether
you have a high school diploma or a G.E.D.? And I'm
confident that I will complete college."
