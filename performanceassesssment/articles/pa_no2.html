	<B>With a No. 2 Pencil, Delete!<br>The destruction of literature in the name of children</B><p>

By Anna Quindlen<br>
Newsweek<br>
June 17, 2002<p>

You can imagine how honored I was to learn that my work 
was going to be mangled for the sake of standardized testing.<p>

   I got the word just after a vigilant parent had discovered that 
statewide English tests in New York had included excerpts from literary 
writers edited so nonsensically that the work had essentially lost all 
meaning. Isaac Bashevis Singer, Annie Dillard, even Chekhov--the pool of 
those singled out for red-penciling by bureaucrats was a distinguished 
one, and I found myself a little disappointed that I had not been turned 
into reading-comp pabulum.<p>

   But the state of Georgia was more accommodating. The folks at the 
Educational Testing Service, one of America's most powerful monopolies, 
were preparing something called the Georgia End-of-Course Tests and 
wanted to use an excerpt from a book I'd written called "How Reading 
Changed My Life."<p>

   In the sentence that read "The Sumerians first used the written word to 
make laundry lists, to keep track of cows and slaves and household 
goods," the words "and slaves" had been deleted.<p>

    And in the sentence "And soon publishers had the means, and the will, 
to publish anything--cookbooks, broadsides, newspapers, novels, poetry, 
pornography, picture books for children," someone had drawn a black line 
through the word "pornography" and written EDIT! <p>

   I got off easy. In the Singer excerpt on New York's Regents exam, which 
was about growing up a Jew in prewar Poland, all references to Jews and 
Poles were excised. Dillard's essay about being the only white child in a 
library in the black section of town became almost unintelligible after 
all references to race were obliterated. <p>

The New York State Education Department's overheated guidelines are written so broadly that only the 
words "the" and "but" seem safe. "Does the material require the parent, 
teacher or examinee to support a position that is contrary to their 
religious beliefs or teaching?" the guidelines ask. "Does the material 
assume that the examinee has experience with a certain type of family 
structure?" As Jeanne Heifetz, an opponent of the required Regents exams 
who uncovered the editing, wrote, "Almost no piece of writing emerges 
from this process unscathed." Nor could any except the most homogenized 
piece of pap about Cape Cod tide pools. <p>

   "The words 'slave' and 'pornography' deal with controversial issues that 
could cause an emotional reaction in some students that could distract 
them from the test and affect their performance," wrote the ETS 
supernumerary snipping at my sentences.<p>

   This was in a week when students likely heard of another suicide bomber 
in Israel, the gunpoint abduction of a teen-ager in Utah and the arrest 
of an R&B star for appearing on videotape having sex with an underage 
girl. And they're going to be distracted by the words "slaves" and 
"pornography"?<p>

   That's the saddest thing here: not the betrayal of writers by 
bureaucrats, but the betrayal of kids by educators. Everyone complains 
that teenagers don't read enough good stuff; the lists of banned books in 
school libraries are thick with quality, with Steinbeck and Margaret 
Atwood. Everyone complains that students are not intellectually engaged; 
controversial issues are excised from those staggeringly boring 
textbooks. Everyone complains that kids are not excited about school; the 
point of school increasingly seems to be incessant testing that doesn't 
even have the grace to be mildly interesting. By the standards of the 
Regents tests, "The Catcher in the Rye" is unacceptable. ("Does the 
material require a student to take a position that challenges parental 
authority?") So are "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "The Merchant of Venice."<p>

   Here is the most shocking question among the New York state guidelines: 
"Does the material assume values not shared by all test takers?" There is 
no book worth reading, no poem worth writing, no essay worth analyzing, 
that assumes the same values for all. That sentence is the death of 
intellectual engagement. <p>

   The education officials in New York have now backed down from their 
cut-and-paste-without-permission position, faced with an angry mob of 
distinguished writers. But what do the kids learn from this? That the 
written word doesn't really matter much, that it can be weakened at will. 
That no one trusts a student to understand that variations in opinion and 
background are both objectively interesting and intellectually 
challenging. That some of the most powerful people involved in their 
education have reduced them to the lowest common denominator.     <p>

   I like kids, have a brace of them around here, and I'm damned (EDIT!) if 
I'm going to abet some skewed adult vision of their febrile emotional 
state. Unlike those in New York, the people preparing tests for the state 
of Georgia at least had the common courtesy to ask permission to mess 
with my stuff. I declined. It's not that one or two words are 
particularly precious; I have hacked away at my own sentences to get them 
to fit tidily in this space. But not to make pabulum for students who 
deserve something tastier.<p>
