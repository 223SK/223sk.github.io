	<B>A Star! A Failure! Unmeshed Yardsticks</b><p>

By MICHAEL WINERIP <br>
New York Times<br>
September 3, 2003<p>


FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. <p>

JACQUELINE McLEOD didn't ask to be principal of T. C.
Berrien Elementary. She had been a principal twice before
and was at a point in her career when she didn't need the
credential, nor the pressure. But once she agreed to take
it on last year, as a favor to Dr. William Harrison, the
county superintendent, Ms. McLeod gave it her all. 
<p>
Her first several months at the poor (90 percent free
lunches), African-American (99.9 percent) school, she spent
her days in classes observing teachers. "How else was I
going to know who could do the job?" Ms. McLeod said. "I
was learning." 
<p>
"She was figuring out which teachers to keep," said Don
Jones, a fifth-grade teacher. "Teachers who could not get
it done, she told them, `You need to find another home.' " 
<p>
Several outstanding teachers from other schools, like
Blanchie Pone, a veteran kindergarten teacher who knew Ms.
McLeod from Lewis Chapel Baptist Church, transferred to
Berrien for the chance to work with the new principal. 
<p>
The school is on a year-round schedule, with nine weeks of
classes followed by three weeks off, but Ms. McLeod would
not let students take a fall break. They had scored poorly
on the state tests the year before she arrived, and Ms.
McLeod told them they needed extra work. "That Monday, just
50 showed up," Ms. McLeod recalled. "I told the bus
drivers, `Find the rest.' We spent the morning calling
homes. By Thursday I had them all.' " She used the break
for reading, math and a theater trip. 
<p>
North Carolina has one of the nation's most demanding
accountability systems, but it also provides substantial
resources for troubled schools. The state gave Ms. McLeod
extra money to reduce class size to 16 and sent a
three-member team to spend a year mentoring teachers. 
<p>
And Ms. McLeod provided the juice. When Shardai Cook was
not doing her homework, Ms. McLeod told the second grader
there'd be a surprise if things improved. Sure enough, one
morning, during the notices, Ms. McLeod announced, "Special
congratulations to Shardai Cook for handing in her homework
every day this week." 
<p>
"I was amazed it was me," said Shardai. "My teacher said,
`Good for you, Shardai.' My mother said, `I'm proud,
Shardai.' My cousin hugged me hard." 
<p>
And Ms. McLeod got results. In June, test scores jumped 11
points, to 66 percent proficient in reading and math. The
state cited Berrien as a high growth school, awarding
teachers $1,500 bonuses. 
<p>
"It was a wow," Ms. McLeod said. But short-lived. Within a
few weeks, the results of the federal No Child Left Behind
assessment system were announced. Under a totally different
federal formula, Berrien barely missed its goal. And since
this was the second year in a row, the school was
sanctioned under federal law. 
<p>
Ms. McLeod, who had just held a school party to celebrate
the state award, now had to send letters offering parents
the right to transfer children out of Berrien, a failing
school, according to the federal system. 
<p>
To local and state officials, Berrien is a school on the
upswing and a prime example of how out of touch with
reality the No Child Left Behind Law is. "This school is
the best I've ever seen it," said Mr. Jones, who has been
teaching eight years. "The feds are sending the wrong
message to teachers, parents and students." 
<p>
Nor is Berrien a statistical oddity. Half of North Carolina
schools have been cited for failing to make adequate
progress under the federal law; and yet hundreds of these
same schools will receive bonuses from the state for
excelling. Here in Cumberland County, 22 schools that
failed in the federal system, excelled in the state system;
while 9 schools that failed to meet their state high growth
goals met the federal goals. 
<p>
Confusing? 
<p>
"Very confusing," said John Dornan, director of the Public
School Forum, which aids North Carolina educators. "We've
been making presentations for months, and it's still
confusing." 
<p>
Last year, Lou Fabrizio, a North Carolina education
official, sat on a federal panel that discussed meshing
state and federal rating systems. "It was discouraging,"
Mr. Fabrizio said. "The first thing we were told is the
federal method for calculating adequate yearly progress was
not on the table for discussion." 
<p>
Some states, like Michigan and Texas, dodged this problem
by lowering the proficiency score they used as a starting
point for measuring progress and instantly saved hundreds
of schools from federal sanctions. But North Carolina had a
system in place for a decade that state officials didn't
want to dumb down. It uses a two-tier assessment that
rewards schools with a high number of proficient students,
as well as schools like Berrien, that started far behind
but made major growth. 
<p>
In contrast, the federal system uses a single yearly
proficiency goal - for North Carolina, 68 percent of
students reading on grade level this year - and requires
all schools to make that number. The problem, Mr. Fabrizio
said, is it's too high for Berrien, but too low for upscale
districts. "We could have a school drop from 86 to 75 and
still be great under the federal system," he said. 
<p>
State educators are upset that federal officials have made
rigid demands and yet finance such a small share of public
education (8 percent in North Carolina compared with 70
percent by the state). "We need after-school programs, we
need skilled personnel," Mr. Dornan said. "The federal
intent is not backed by resources." President Bush budgeted
$12 billion for No Child Left Behind, $6 billion below what
the law allows. 
<p>
Ms. McLeod, who, like almost all of her students, is
African-American, took the job because, she said, "you come
to a point in life when you know you have the skills to
make a difference." She helped raise $50,000 for a
playground, persuaded Mr. Jones, "a superb teacher," to
stay another year. She was disappointed by the federal
sanctions. "It didn't reflect the work we did last year,"
she said. "I can show you how far I've brought them. They
grew. They grew." 
<p>
And they know it. "Last year I could read chapter books a
little," said Lamont Lyles, 9. "Now I'm reading an
18-chapter book." 
<p>
Ms. McLeod said, "Just awesome."
