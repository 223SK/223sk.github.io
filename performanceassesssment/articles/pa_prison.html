	<B>Raising the Bars<br>
Complete sentences: Turning students into prison inmates</B><p>

A simple solution would avert the budget disaster facing California's
schools: We should declare every public school to be a prison. The kids
would understand.<p>

Details need to be worked out, but I want every child in California to be
given a 13-year prison sentence at age 5, with the possibility of a
four-year extension.<p>

That way, the $7,000 the state spends per student each year could
immediately be raised to $27,000 -- what the state spends on each inmate
annually. And our criminally under-funded schools would qualify for the
only category in the governor's proposed budget that's slated to get more
money this year.<p>

Gov. Gray Davis is asking for a 1 percent budget increase for the
California Department of Corrections. Meanwhile, our schools are flinching
at threats of abusive slashes in state support.<p>

Given the alternative of layoffs, more crowded classrooms, fewer teachers'
aides and disappearing supplies, school officials should jump for joy at
the chance for their district's schools to be transformed into prisons and
their students to become inmates.<p>

My daughter's middle school in San Francisco would be renamed Herbert
Hoover Juvenile Correctional Institution. Her brother's elementary school
could be Buena Vista Juvenile Redirective Ranch. The university from which
my sister just graduated would become the California Honor Farm at Davis.<p>

The benefits are many.<p>

Elementary schools in San Francisco haven't been staffed with sch   1ool nurses
for many years. Recent court cases, however, have set minimal levels for
acceptable health care for prisoners. If schools suddenly became prisons,
students would be entitled to the same health-care standards.<p>

Prison nurses would step in and school secretaries, administrators and
teachers' aides could get back to educating -- instead of tending to the
endless parade of students needing Band- Aids, ice packs, lice checks and
help with their asthma inhalers.<p>

Labor relations and staff morale would improve. Math, science and English
teachers could sign on as members of the California Correctional Peace
Officers Association, which represents prison guards. The union, which has
given $3 million to Davis campaigns since 1998, has the clout to keep
salaries growing and benefits flowing.<p>

The prison gua   …rds union's Web site used to brag that its members earned
higher salaries than teachers in California. That boast, wisely, has
disappeared from the site. Nonetheless, if our schools became prisons and
our teachers were covered by the same union contracts as prison guards,
educators would get the immediate raises they deserve.<p>

Prison guards deserve every penny they get. It's a tough and stressful line
of work, often unappreciated by the inmates and their families. Sound like
a teacher's job?
<p>
From Lakeshore Elementary Jail to Lowell State Penitentiary, wardens and
their little inmates should move quickly to get formal status under the
California Department of Corrections. Otherwise, county hospitals and
nursing homes might beat them to it.<p>
