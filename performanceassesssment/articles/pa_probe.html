	<B>TEA probe finds evidence of thousands of misreported students</B><br><I>State says HISD didn't count dropouts</I><p>

By ZANTO PEABODY <br>
Houston Chronicle<br>
April 3, 2003<P>
 
The Houston school system may have thousands more dropouts than it claims in
state records, investigators have found, leading to inaccurately high
accountability ratings that can translate to bonuses for employees.<p>

In checks at 12 high schools, Texas Education Agency investigators so far
have discovered that HISD employees keep terribly sloppy records and skirt
state documentation laws when they claim a student leaves to get a GED. The
auditors are probing 16 schools in an investigation expected to end soon.<p>

TEA, which is investigating claims of false dropout reports at Sharpstown
High School, has found instance after instance of students all over the
district who quit school but were not counted, according to e-mails among
members of the agency's Special Data Inquiry Unit that were obtained by the
Houston Chronicle. The investigative arm of TEA has so far turned up 1,557
apparent dropouts, some from schools that reported no one had quit school in
the 2000-01 school year, the most recent records available.<p>

An HISD administrator said he had no reason to believe district employees
filed fraudulent records. The confusion, he said, lies in the state's
multiple definitions of a dropout. Schools have dozens of ways to code
students who leave, many of whom are not officially considered dropouts.<p>

"I would like to believe there is not a situation where people are
intentionally changing the records," said Jaime de la Isla, HISD's assistant
superintendent who oversees the district's dropout-prevention programs. "If
it has happened, there will be consequences for that."<p>

A dropout rate that does not come close to reflecting reality is not new for
HISD or the state. In October, the district assigned a task force to come up
with a more realistic way to calculate the rate. A bill in the state
Legislature would align the state's dropout formula to the national one.<p>

But TEA auditors, encountering what they called a "palpable" air of anxiety,
seemed stunned at how far off HISD's statistics are.<p>

One investigator asked if the public could handle it if TEA stripped the
esteemed Houston Independent School District of its "acceptable" rating.
HISD has been recognized nationally for reviving its reputation as a leading
urban district, most notably by winning the Broad Prize for overall
improvement. <p>

Investigator L.T. Bailey said his findings of sloppy or missing records were
"alarming." <p>

"Are we prepared for HISD and public reaction to the finding?" Bailey wrote
in a March 12 e-mail to a colleague.<p>

Yates High School, for example, reported a 0.4 percent dropout rate for
2001. At that rate, only four out of every 1,000 Yates students would have
quit school before graduation. Bailey's e-mail said investigators combing
student files found 373 dropouts, more than the number who graduated from
the school in 2001.<p>

While HISD officials have publicly questioned their own dropout reports,
they deny knowledge of employees falsifying records.<p>

TEA auditors have not said school workers knowingly filed false reports, but
they did find occurrences where a student whose paperwork suggested he
dropped out was entered otherwise.<p>

Missing signatures, omitted dates and improper coding have stymied the
search for who's a dropout and who's not.<p>

"In many cases, the documentation is so inadequate or disjointed that we
cannot ascertain the facts of a student's withdrawal," Bailey's e-mail said.<p>

Much of TEA's concern centers on "leaver" codes, the identifiers that tell
the state why a student left school. The codes indicate reasons from
military leave to pregnancy, from death to getting a GED.<p>

Auditors converted HISD's inadequately documented leavers to code 99, the
shorthand for a student whose whereabouts are unknown. Those converted
records count as dropouts.<p>

TEA changed the codes of all but 10 of the 383 students who left Yates to
code 99. <p>

In other cases, school employees said students left to earn a GED, but
records did not have the required signatures from students confirming the
claim. <p>

"If it was permissible for school officials to declare intent for a student,
they could state anything they please and we would be obliged to accept
their word as verification," Bailey wrote.<p>

De la Isla, HISD's assistant superintendent, said he doubts anyone in the
district would intentionally deflate dropout rates. Employees by and large
follow the state rules in counting students who leave, he said.<p>

Mobile students in big cities are hard to keep up with, de la Isla said, and
schools often do not know whether a student quit school or just moved. A
student may leave the district at any time, but the school may not record
someone as missing until the beginning of the next year. In the meantime,
the student may have moved without a forwarding address or otherwise gotten
out of the school's reach, de la Isla said.<p>

"We have tried to encourage schools to do their very best to get out there
and find them," he said. "Sometimes we have done marvelously well, located
kids out of state and have documentation to support that. It's been
difficult given limited resources. "<p>

He also said many students who quit school are not considered dropouts by
the state, a stance reflected in the dozens of leaver codes. HISD's 1.8
percent dropout rate is not much different from the statewide average, which
hovers around 2 percent.<p>

A declining dropout rate in the district is not the result of fuzzy math, de
la Isla said, but a result of HISD taking great pains to cut down on
students quitting without a diploma. The assistant superintendent's job was
created in 1995 when then-Superintendent Rod Paige launched his Student
Retention Initiative.<p>

Reports of erroneous dropout records run "against what I have observed over
last 10 years," de la Isla said. "In the 1995-96 school year, we were on
warned status because of dropouts. Our accreditation was in peril. We have
put much greater priority on this and encouraged schools to do a better
job." <p>

State officials acknowledge the somewhat arbitrary nature of the dropout
formula. TEA calculates another dropout figure by following students from
seventh grade to the end of high school. For Houston, that 12.7 percent
dropout rate is not the one reflected on accountability reports.<p>

Houston's figures are under scrutiny because of allegations of false reports
at Sharpstown High School. Employees at that school earned bonuses in part
because of the low dropout rate.<p>

"When a superintendent signs off on that record, it's signing an affidavit
that it is true and accurate," TEA spokeswoman Debbie Graves Ratcliffe said,
declining to speak specifically about the investigation. "The allegation
down there is that the record is not accurate."
