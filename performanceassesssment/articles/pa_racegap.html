	<B>School research gets to race gap: Not just black students affected</b><p>

After years of hand-wringing over an "intolerable and persistent" racial achievement gap at Oak Park and River Forest High School, school leaders have released new research that suggests grade inflation for white students and identity issues for black students play major roles.<p>

The research, begun two years ago, was an attempt by the diverse suburban high school to move beyond the conventional hunches to more evidence-based findings that include detailed grade data from feeder schools and exhaustive interviews with African-American students.<p>

"This study has some broad implications for other schools struggling with this issue," said Ted Manley, a DePaul University sociologist who served on the research team. "This demonstrates that the achievement gap affects all students. We tend to see this as problem for [minority] students, but there are some hidden consequences for white students." The achievement gap is going to become a thorny problem at hundreds of Illinois schools, even high-achieving ones with overwhelmingly white populations. That's because the federal No Child Left Behind law will consider schools "academically troubled" if even one subgroup of students--minority, low-income, limited-English or special education students--falls short of state standards on math or reading tests.<p>

One finding from the Oak Park data is the pervasive disparity in grading. It exists in every category of coursework--honors, special education, even driver's education.<p>

The average GPA, weighted by course difficulty, of a white student at Oak Park-River Forest is a grade level higher than it is for black students--3.29 compared with 2.31. This one-point differential is nearly identical for black and white students coming from Oak Park's Elementary District 97, which, researchers said, dispels the myth that struggling black students were transferring to the high school from outside districts.<p>

Oak Park school leaders said the research is the first step in rooting out the causes of this difference, which is more social than intellectual, researchers said.<p>

They pointed to various causes. White kids get more coaching in how to navigate the school bureaucracy from family members and peers--how to get coveted courses and work for a higher grade. Black students reported feeling inspired by far fewer teachers than their white peers did. Some teachers and counselors don't feel as comfortable around black students and make assumptions about their ability based on behavior and other biases.<p>

"The findings are startling, troubling and compelling. They not only show that the gap is systemic, but they also reveal nuances that raise questions about grading standards and teacher expectation as well as perceptions of expectations of white and black students," the report on the research concluded. "The gap suggests that two communities exist at the high school: one for white students that places them at academic promise and another for black students that places them at academic risk."<p>

White students are more than twice as likely to receive an A, and black students are more than four times as likely to receive an F. White students, whether male or female, saw their GPAs increase during their four years at the high school. For black students, the average GPA was unchanged from 9th grade to graduation.<p>

Moreover, standardized test scores of black students are more consistent with their GPAs than are those of white students. Researchers suggested that could be caused by grade inflation, particularly in honors courses dominated by white students. This grading disparity exists even among the brightest students--black and white seniors who have taken a dozen or more honors courses. This proves damaging not only to black students, officials argued, but it also gives white students an inflated sense of their abilities.<p>

Rich Deptuch, Oak Park-River Forest's assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction, has been studying this issue for years--at his school and as a member of a national group called the Minority Student Achievement Network.<p>

Research has shown common factors that feed the gulf between white and minority students--disparities in income, family education, expectations and peer group influences. Yet Deptuch was surprised by how insidious the grade differences played out, yet encouraged by the finding that his school's most successful black students were not those who "acted white" but rather those who learned to advance in a white culture while holding onto social ties across both races.<p>

"It boils down to learning how to play the game, knowing what to do to please the teacher and produce a good grade," Deptuch said. "We're talking with kids about how to do this without losing your pride, without losing face. Or how do you confront a teacher without getting into trouble."<p>

The study already has sparked practical changes. To address the isolation black students experience in honors courses, school officials tweaked scheduling to allow black students to be "clustered" in certain advanced courses instead of assigned randomly by a computer. Another change took some general-track minority students, whose test scores suggested they could handle a more challenging curriculum, and offered them extra help to take honors courses.<p>

Another program identified 8th graders who were struggling in middle school--two-thirds of whom were black males--and started mentoring them last summer and throughout the school year.<p>

Oak Park history teacher Michael Mitchell was one of those mentors, meeting with a dozen at-risk freshmen who needed academic help and practical advice that gives them the kind of grading edge that many of their white peers take for granted.<p>

"I talked to them about playing the game in class, making eye contact with the teacher, taking notes, bringing in the textbook, being on time," Mitchell said. "You have to keep preaching it because we're talking about kids who have been doing the opposite for eight years."<p>

Mitchell considers the program a success because of the difference he can make for a handful of students. One of his students finished his freshman year with all As and Bs; another, who was flunking all his classes at mid-term, ended up passing all but one course.<p>
