	<B>Scores on Math Regents Exam to Be Raised for Thousands</b><p>

By KAREN W. ARENSON<br>
New York Times<br>
August 30, 2003<p>


Thousands of students who initially failed the troubled
Math A Regents exam in June will receive passing grades
under a new scoring chart issued yesterday by the New York
State Education Department, a department spokesman said. 
<p>
Nearly two-thirds of the 10th graders who took the exam -
which is required to graduate from high school - will pass,
compared with one-third under the original scoring, the
department estimated. 
<p>
The rescoring of the test, which a state committee found to
be far more difficult than in previous years, is also
expected to mean that about 80 percent of the ninth-grade
students will pass, compared to 61 percent before. (The
department still does not know how many students took the
test or what scores they received; its estimates are based
on a survey in June of 400 school districts around the
state.) Under the rescoring, all students who originally
scored 47 or higher will receive 65 or higher, which is
passing. 
<p>
So many students failed the Math A exam in June that they
and their teachers and principals bombarded the Education
Department with complaints that the test was unfair. After
a quick survey, the department agreed that it appeared more
difficult than in previous years. It voided test scores for
juniors and seniors, and appointed an outside committee of
experts to analyze what went wrong. That panel recommended
that all scores be raised, and the Education Department
issued a table yesterday showing how much each score will
be raised. 
<p>
The state introduced Math A, which covers topics like
algebra, geometry and trigonometry, to try to raise the
level of math education. It requires more problem solving
and covers more material than the previous entry-level high
school math course, Math 1. 
<p>
Most students take Math A over three semesters rather than
a year; some spread it out over two years. Many students
take the test in 10th grade, but good math students take it
earlier. Weaker ones often take it later. 
<p>
Some of the original test scores will not change at all; a
zero will remain a zero, for example, and a 100 will remain
a 100. But other test scores will be raised by as many as
18 points. An original score of 47 will be lifted 18 points
to a 65, which is passing. An original score of 65 will be
raised 10 points to a 75. And all scores between 93 and 99
will become 99 after conversion. (The full conversion chart
is available on the department's Web site, www.nysed.gov.) 
<p>
Some teachers, like Steven Levine, a special-education
math teacher at White Plains High School in Westchester
County, welcomed the rescoring, but questioned the
difficulty of the Math A curriculum and exam. 
<p>
"Too many of the kids are failing this test," Mr. Levine
said. "I don't disagree with raising standards, but I think
we went too far." 
<p>
He and other teachers suggested that the state return to
testing students after one year of study, rather than after
18 months or two years. 
<p>
The math study committee is expected to deliver its full
assessment and recommendations in October.
