	<B>States Are Relaxing Standards on Tests to Avoid Sanctions</B><p>

By SAM DILLON <br>

AUSTIN, Tex. - Security was tight when Texas State Board of
Education members were given results last fall from a field
trial of a new statewide achievement test. Guards stood
outside their locked meeting room, and board members were
asked to sign a secrecy pledge, reflecting the sensitivity
of the situation. <p>

"The results were grim," said Chase Untermeyer, a member.
"Few students did well. Many students got almost no answers
right." <p>

Fearing that thousands of students would fail the new test
and be held back a grade, and that hundreds of schools
could face penalties under the federal No Child Left Behind
law, the board voted to reduce the number of questions that
students must answer correctly to pass it, to 20 out of 36,
from 24, for third-grade reading. <p>

Texas has not been alone in lowering its testing standards
in recent months. Educators in other states have been
making similar decisions as they seek to avoid the
penalties that the federal law imposes on schools whose
students fare poorly on standardized tests. Since President
Bush signed the law in January 2002, all 50 states have
presented plans for compliance. But some experts say there
is only a veneer of acquiescence. Quietly, they say, states
are doing their best to avoid costly sanctions. <p>

Michigan's standards had been among the nation's highest,
which caused problems last year when 1,513 schools there
were labeled under the law as needing improvement, more
than in any other state. So Michigan officials lowered the
percentage of students who must pass statewide tests to
certify a school as making adequate progress - to 42
percent, from 75 percent of high school students on English
tests, for example. That reduced the number of schools so
labeled to 216. <p>

Colorado employed another tactic that will result in fewer
schools being labeled as needing improvement. It overhauled
the grading system used on its tests, lumping students
previously characterized on the basis of test scores as
"partially proficient" with those called "proficient." <p>

"Some states are lowering the passing scores, they're
redefining schools in need of improvement and they're
deferring the hard task of achievement-boosting into the
distant future," said Chester E. Finn Jr., a former
assistant secretary of education who supports the law's
goal of raising standards. "That's a really cynical
approach." <p>

Under the law, states that fail to comply risk losing
federal education money. Schools deemed failing several
years in a row must offer tutoring to low-achieving
students and, eventually, can be forced into complete
reorganization. But the law leaves it up to the states to
establish their own standards of success. <p>

Some experts also fault the law for requiring states to
bring 100 percent of students up to proficiency in reading
and math by 2014, a level they say has never been achieved
in any state or country. <p>

"The severe sanctions may hinder educational excellence,"
said Robert L. Linn, a professor at the University of
Colorado who is the immediate past president of the
American Educational Research Association, "because they
implicitly encourage states to water down their content and
performance standards in order to reduce the risk of
sanctions." <p>

Federal officials disagree. Dan Langan, a spokesman for the
Department of Education, said the department had closely
monitored all states' preparations for compliance with the
law and was satisfied that the law would not bring lower
standards. "The law includes safeguards to hold states
accountable," Mr. Langan said. "They have flexibility to
set proficiency levels, but there are enough checks in
place to make sure they cannot game the system. <p>

"So we reject the argument that states won't set and keep
high standards," he said. <p>

The 600-page law, Mr. Bush's basic education initiative,
was passed with bipartisan backing four months after Sept.
11, 2001. Many prominent Democrats, however, have since
withdrawn their support, including Representative Richard
A. Gephardt of Missouri, who recently described it as "a
phony gimmick." <p>

"We were all suckered into it," Mr. Gephardt said. "It's a
fraud." <p>

Four United States senators are backing a bill that would
allow states to obtain waivers from the law's requirements,
and legislators in Minnesota, New Hampshire and Hawaii are
considering proposals for those states to opt out of it.
That would put at risk millions of dollars in federal
financing, but could allow the states to avoid the costs of
compliance. <p>

In a report this month, the General Accounting Office
estimated that states would have to spend $1.9 billion to
$5.3 billion to develop and administer the new tests the
law requires. State and federal officials disagree as to
whether Congress has appropriated enough money to help the
states meet those costs. <p>

Richard F. Elmore, an education professor at Harvard,
writing in the spring issue of the newsletter Education
Next, called the law "the single largest, and the single
most damaging, expansion of federal power over the nation's
education system in history." <p>

Mr. Langan, the Education Department spokesman, again
disagreed. "This law appropriately identifies education as
a national priority, and we believe it values and respects
local control and autonomy," he said. <p>

A feature of the law that even many critics praise is its
promotion of learning by minority and other students whose
achievement has lagged. It requires states to publish those
groups' test scores separately, and imposes sanctions on
schools if the scores of any group fail to meet annual
targets two years in a row. <p>

But many educators question whether schools can meet the
requirement to raise all students' scores to 100 percent
proficiency by 2014, and some states' plans appear intended
to buy time. <p>

Ohio, for instance, vowed to raise the percentage of
students who pass statewide tests to 60 percent from 40
percent in six years, an average annual gain of 3.3
percentage points. But starting in 2010, it pledged to
raise the percentage to 100 percent from 60 percent in just
four years, an average annual gain of 10 percentage points,
which some educators said would require a near miracle. <p>

Mr. Finn compared Ohio's approach to a balloon mortgage in
which a home buyer pays low interest in early years, but
later faces soaring, unpayable rates. <p>

Mitchell Chester, an assistant superintendent in the Ohio
Education Department, defended the state's timetable,
saying in an interview that Ohio needed the next few years
both to raise the achievement of minority and other
low-performing children to the other students' starting
point of 40 percent proficiency, and to "re-engineer"
instruction with a more ambitious curriculum and more
teacher training. Very rapid progress in achievement will
be possible thereafter, Mr. Chester said. <p>

Dr. Linn outlined another interpretation in a recent speech
to educational researchers. Ohio and other states face a
huge challenge "to get through the first years without
placing an overwhelming number of schools in the
improvement category," he said. "Buying time allows for the
possibility that the law will be modified to make progress
targets more realistically achievable. The Ohio plan is, in
my view, a creative way of doing that." <p>

Texas's plans for compliance with the law are of special
interest because Mr. Bush drew heavily on his record of
raising test scores there to sell the federal law to
Congress. <p>

But experts have criticized the test used throughout Mr.
Bush's governorship as too easy; far easier, for instance,
than New York's Regents exam. Partly in response, Texas
developed a new, more rigorous test, the Texas Assessment
of Knowledge and Skills. It fell to the Texas State Board
last fall to decide how many questions students would have
to answer correctly to pass it. <p>

The stakes were high because starting this year, third
graders must pass the test to advance to fourth grade and
also because if thousands of students failed it, many
schools might not meet the federal law's requirement of
adequate yearly progress, Criss Cloudt, an associate
commissioner at the Texas Education Agency, said in an
interview. <p>

"We were trying to avoid that in the same year in which we
ratchet up our targets for No Child Left Behind, we would
at the same time greatly increase what we expected of
students on the test," Ms. Cloudt said, "because that
combination was likely to cause a dramatic increase in
schools not meeting adequate yearly progress."
