	<B>New Law May Leave Many Rural Teachers Behind</B><p>

By SAM DILLON<br>
New York Times<br>
June 20, 2003<P>
 
WINNETT, Mont., June 20 - It is not easy for rural towns to
recruit young teachers like Nicholas Tholt - not when, as
in Winnett, the newspaper has stopped printing, the nearest
movie theater is 53 miles away and there are only two
stores, one saloon and the Kozy Korner Cafe. <p>

But Mr. Tholt settled here last year, partly because the
school board sweetened his $19,667 annual salary by
offering him a house trailer for $150 a month. Now he is
Winnett's one-man social studies program, teaching history,
civics, geography and American government in the high
school, which has just 33 students. The state says Mr.
Tholt is fully certified, and townspeople say he does a
darn good job. <p>

But a new federal law challenges his credentials, saying
all teachers must have a separate college degree in the
field of each major course they teach, or prove through an
exam that they are "highly qualified" in that area of
study. <p>

Mr. Tholt, who is 25, plans to continue teaching in this
gritty town surrounded by cattle ranches and antelope herds
on Montana's eastern prairie. But the law is forcing him
and thousands of other rural teachers to consider returning
to school or moving elsewhere. <p>

"Montana thinks I'm a qualified teacher, but the federal
government doesn't agree," he said. <p>

Officials in Helena, Mont., and several other state
capitals say the federal law seems intended to shake up big
city schools but includes provisions unsuited to the needs
of America's sparsely populated regions. They warn that
among other pernicious effects, it is likely to accelerate
the migration of teachers to urban districts out of
struggling communities from Maine to Alaska. <p>

"To tell teachers who barely make $20,000 a year that they
have to go back to college - frankly it would be easier for
them to retire or move to a state where they could just
teach one subject," said Linda McCulloch, Montana's
superintendent of public instruction. "This could just
throw our educational system into a mess." <p>

The full impact of the law, known as No Child Left Behind,
will depend on the flexibility given to rural states in
applying its provisions, and so far the Bush administration
has sent mixed signals. President Bush frequently describes
the law as a triumph of education reform, and state
officials report that White House officials have been
adamant in refusing to grant waivers. <p>

Education Secretary Rod Paige, who was superintendent of
schools in Houston while Mr. Bush was governor of Texas,
has also insisted on the strict interpretation of the law.
But amid a mounting outcry from rural states, he has seemed
willing to bend. <p>

"The law has good things, but it affects us negatively - so
I can't imagine there's anybody in rural America that
doesn't have problems with it," Gov. Judy Martz of Montana,
a Republican, said in an interview. <p>

At a governors' meeting in February, Governor Martz said,
she buttonholed Dr. Paige and voiced her complaints. He
responded, she said, by telling her, "You're not the only
one raising these issues." <p>

Other Republicans from rural states also raised their
voices. Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the powerful
chairman of the Appropriations Committee, criticized a
school choice provision requiring districts to allow
students from schools with low test scores to transfer to
better schools, at the district's expense. <p>

Senator Stevens called that unreasonable for Alaska, but
Dr. Paige stuck by the provision - until he traveled last
month with the state's other senator, Lisa Murkowski, to
tour schools in the Alaskan bush. After he flew into one
village on a Blackhawk helicopter because a plane had
foundered in the thawing tundra, he seemed stunned by the
"swamplike conditions," Senator Murkowski recalled in an
interview. <p>

Dr. Paige later visited a public school on remote St.
Lawrence Island, where enforcing the law's choice provision
would require flying students to another school 164 miles
across the Bering Sea. <p>

"You couldn't have described this situation to us
adequately to get the understanding we've gained as a
result of seeing it with our own eyes," Dr. Paige said
before flying back to Washington, The Associated Press
reported. This month, Senator Murkowski announced that the
Education Department had agreed to relax the law's
requirements for Alaskan schools that are "too isolated to
practically offer school choice." <p>

But Susan K. Sclafani, counselor to the secretary of
education, noted in an interview that "to its credit"
Alaska had not requested a formal waiver from the law, and
Maine, which did request a waiver, was turned down. So
whether any of the flexibility shown to Alaska will be
extended to other rural states remains unclear. <p>

"It's true that it's more of a challenge to implement No
Child Left Behind in rural areas," Ms. Sclafani said.
"We'll take a look at each state's conditions." But rural
states should plan to comply with the law, she said,
including its requirements that teachers be "highly
qualified" in every core subject they teach. <p>

"We've raised the bar," Ms. Sclafani said. "We have to
improve student achievement, and a critical part of low
achievement is the lack of preparation of our teachers. You
can't teach what you don't know." <p>

Educators praise the law for focusing attention on minority
students, and for imposing sanctions on schools where
achievement does not improve. But it has aroused tremendous
criticism, and not only from rural states. Everywhere,
teachers and principals are angry, saying that the law will
eventually lead to a majority of America's 90,000 public
schools' being labeled low-performing. <p>

In New York, parents say its promise of relief from failing
schools is hollow because there are insufficient seats in
better schools to accommodate those requesting transfers.
Some experts say the law requires too many standardized
tests. <p>

Conflict with rural states promises to be especially
intense if the Education Department decides to enforce the
law's teacher competency rules strictly. In an interview,
Doug Christensen, Nebraska's commissioner of education,
called those rules "a horrible part of the legislation." <p>

"We have so many schools where one person teaches biology,
chemistry, physics and the physical, earth and life
sciences," Mr. Christensen said. "This law would make them
have a major in each subject - and that's just physically
impossible." <p>

In Winnett, Eric Jolma has taught those six courses for
nine years. A lanky 34-year-old outdoorsman, he is using
the summer to build his own house in the shadow of a
towering butte east of town. His degree from Montana State
University is in secondary education - broad field science,
the major that prepares educators to serve as one-person
science departments in small towns. <p>

The federal law could require Mr. Jolma, like Mr. Tholt, to
pass new competency tests in all the subjects he teaches or
return to college for additional course work - something
Mr. Jolma said he simply could not swing on his $25,967
annual salary. <p>

The precise requirements of the law, which is 650 pages
long, remain murky to many educators and state officials,
and they are awaiting clarification from Washington. <p>

At the Winnett school, a dozen ranch men and women were
gathering one evening last week for a school board meeting,
preparing to discuss the purchase of a school bus, the
wording of a dress code and the hiring of a janitor. Talk
turned to the new law. <p>

"The people in Washington making these rules have no
concept of what rural Montana is like," said Jolene Shaw, a
board member who lives on a ranch east of town. <p>

Chris King, another rancher and a former board member,
nodded in agreement. With Winnett's tiny class sizes - this
fall the 7th and 11th grades will have just four students
each - teachers can develop an intimate understanding of
each pupil's academic progress without testing, he said. <p>

"We're not leaving children behind," Mr. King said. "So why
don't they just let us alone?" <p>

Before the meeting, Clay Dunlap, Winnett's superintendent
and principal, finished rereading several pages of the law,
faxed to him by officials in Helena, detailing the new
teacher competency requirements. <p>

"I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but I can't
tell you what this law means," Mr. Dunlap said. "But what's
obvious is that Washington doesn't understand the needs of
a remote community like ours. <p>

"And that's our concern - this law is one size fits all.
Why is Washington telling Montana how to certify teachers?"
