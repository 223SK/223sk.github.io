	<B>Accountability Sham: State, Federal Tests Results Conflict</b><p>


Bradenton (FL) Editorial<br>
August 10, 2003<p>


The fallacy of basing education policy on arbitrary testing results was 
never more clearly demonstrated than in the recent score given to 
Manatee County schools by the federal government.<p>

The federal results, based on President George W. Bush's No Child Left 
Behind program, said 49 of the district's 56 schools flunked the test. 
The failure list included all of the middle schools and high schools in 
Manatee County. Two elementary schools, Wakeland and Samoset, were 
singled out with F grades for the second year. Being labeled as F 
schools twice means that parents in those two school attendance zones 
have the option of transferring their children to a higher performing 
school, with transportation provided by the school district.<p>

But wait. Just a few weeks earlier, all of Manatee's schools were given 
passing grades in the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test program 
initiated by Gov. Jeb Bush. Twelve of those that earned A's in the state 
test were on the failure list of the federal test. Wakeland and Samoset, 
having moved from F in 2002 to C in 2003 on the FCAT, were jubilant. 
Now, just a few days before the start of a new school year, parents are 
told the schools are failures.<p>

Which is it? Which set of tests is to be believed? Which Bush policy is 
the right one, the president's or the governor's? And what does the 
discrepancy in ratings say about the authenticity of either one?<p>

The answer, of course, is that neither represents a fair and accurate 
picture of the quality of education being provided to students here or 
elsewhere in the state, which had a 90 percent failure rate in the 
federal test. Rather, they are snapshots of student performance as 
measured by an arbitrary set of standards. But they don't necessarily 
reflect teachers' success at educating children with widely varied 
levels of ability, socialization and language mastery. Throw in a 
different set of standards and you likely would get yet another, 
entirely different result.<p>

The results are so confusing that even veteran educators profess that 
they're not sure what they mean or how to respond.<p>

Yet the district has to shuffle transportation plans and teacher 
assignments with little notice to accommodate 80 students who have asked 
to transfer from so-called failing schools to higher-rated ones. It is 
tough enough to launch a new academic year with 1,100 additional 
students and severe state funding constraints without jumping through 
all of these funding and logistical hoops created by politicians with no 
apparent understanding of the process of teaching children.<p>

Standardized testing is fine as a gauge of weak areas, indicating where 
more resources might be needed. But it is wrong to attach stigmatizing 
grades to entire schools - tarring all teachers and administrators with 
the same brush - based on a single, arbitrary test. Even worse is to 
base rewards and punishments to schools based on such test results, as 
both the federal and state plans do. Both trigger voucher eligibility 
for F-schools, and the state's triggers a bonus plan for A-schools.<p>

It is a misrepresentation to call such measurement "educational reform" 
and claim it as bringing "accountability to public education," as both 
President Bush and Gov. Bush do. Where's the accountability for such 
conflicting grades for the same teachers and same students?
