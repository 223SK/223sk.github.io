	<B>State Education Commissioner Keeps Smiling Through an Outcry</b><p>

By KAREN W. ARENSON <br>
New York Times<br>
July 7, 2003<p>


June was not an easy month for Richard P. Mills, New York
State's education commissioner. <p>

There was the furor over the state's Math A Regents exam,
which Mr. Mills declared unfair, setting aside the results.
Then there was the outcry over the physics Regents exam, a
test that Mr. Mills acknowledged was hard but that he
staunchly declined to withdraw. There were the attacks on
New York's standards-based testing system. And finally,
there was the resignation of the department's top testing
official after Mr. Mills tried to reassign her. <p>

And yet last week, Mr. Mills, 58, was unbowed and crowing
about victories for New York's testing program. <p>

"This is very definitely a high moment now," he said in an
interview. <p>

He referred to the ruling by the New York State Court of
Appeals that the state owes all its students a solid
education, a vindication, he said, of the high standards
that he and the Regents are insisting on for all students.
Another victory, he said, is rising test scores; he had
just gone to Patricia A. DiChiaro elementary school in
Yonkers, to celebrate the improvement in elementary school
results. <p>

"I really don't have low moments," he said, adding that he
did not see the criticism of his department as a setback,
but as part of the price of leadership. <p>

"Every superintendent, every college president, will tell
you that leadership is challenging," he said. "That is just
what it is. If you don't want that in your life, you do
other work." <p>

That kind of attitude may be admirable to some, but critics
say they are not sure what planet the commissioner is
living on. They include students who have devoted hours to
math and physics - with Saturday sessions and tutoring -
only to fail the tough Regents exams. Teachers who have
spent hours coaching their students to reach higher levels
only to see them score poorly. Parents upset that their
children's graduation will hinge on the outcome of a few
exams. Readers offended by what they see as the
"butchering" of classic literary texts on the English exams
to remove references to race and sex that might be
offensive. <p>

Jane Hirschmann, chairwoman of the Parents' Coalition to
End High Stakes Testing, which has thousands of members
around New York State, is among critics who complained
about what they perceive as Mr. Mills's inflexibility. "He
has an agenda and is not willing to listen to anyone," she
said in an interview. "He is hellbent on seeing that
high-stakes testing dominates the school curriculum, and
that is not the way to go." <p>

Critics, including Ms. Hirschmann, have called for the
commissioner's removal, but the Regents, who appointed him,
have stood behind him. His positions are sure to be an
issue when the Assembly and Senate education committees
conduct hearings on the state's testing policies later this
summer. <p>

"We've seen such problems with the tests," said Assemblyman
Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the
Assembly's Education Committee. "With the compilation of
the questions, the censorship of information, the scoring
of the exams. To say the test itself is so important
relative to the whole body of work the student has done is
flawed. <p>

"I know that Commissioner Mills is dedicated to students
and I applaud him for that," he said. "I think that
Commissioner Mills is entirely sincere. But it's ironic
that when he was in Vermont he championed a whole different
approach based on portfolios of student work, not just
exams." <p>

But people who know the commissioner well, like Carl T.
Hayden, the former Regents chancellor, say such criticism
is likely to have little effect. <p>

"He won't quit now," Mr. Hayden said. "He is not about to
be deterred by what happened. He is very deeply committed
to making opportunity more widely available, to advancing
the principle of equity." 
<p>
And Kati Haycock, a Mills supporter who is the director of
the Education Trust, an education standards advocacy group
based in Washington, says testing problems are to be
expected - and must be dealt with quickly and honestly -
but are more than compensated for by the results. <p>

"If a state were just heading down this course for the
first time, people would be right to ask if they really
know what they are doing," she said. "But New York State
has had decades of experience with Regents exams, and not
that many problems. For me, the question is: Are New York
kids learning more than when Rick came? And are the kids
who were especially behind catching up? The answer to both
is a resounding yes." <p>

Closing the gap between poor and minority students and
others is part of what Mr. Mills pledged to do when he
arrived in New York in 1995. He is passionate about the
need for demanding standards - and for regular tests to see
whether they are being met. He is meticulously well
organized, a strategic thinker and an almost compulsive
communicator - he writes weekly memos to the 16 Regents,
meets monthly with regional school district superintendents
and periodically talks with key figures like the teachers'
union president, legislative leaders and the New York City
schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein. <p>

"Certainly with me, he's been enormously hands-on and
substantive," said Mr. Klein, who recently persuaded Mr.
Mills to extend the city's use of uncertified teachers. <p>

The way Mr. Mills tackled the problems with the Math A
Regents exam offers a glimpse into his style. <p>

Students took the exam on June 17, and the complaints
started almost immediately: The test was too hard. It
covered material the students had not learned. It did not
cover material they had studied. It had too many trick
problems. Some questions had more than one right answer. <p>

By June 19, the complaints reaching Mr. Mills had begun to
balloon, from the Regents, district superintendents,
parents, students and teachers whose messages were sent to
him. He began to try to gauge how serious the criticisms
were. <p>

He tried the test (and passed, though he will not say with
what score). He assembled a team of advisers - experts in
technical issues, curriculum, testing, finance,
communications and politics. He solicited preliminary test
results. He asked the Regents, the superintendents and
others what they thought. He called Mr. Klein and Randi
Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers.
He asked testing experts to compare the last three Math A
exams. He talked three times with Matthew Goldstein, a
mathematical statistician who is chancellor of the City
University of New York. <p>

The fact finding continued through that weekend. And as Mr.
Mills awaited data, he hammered out six possible options. <p>

According to the preliminary data, 63 percent of students
who had taken the exam failed. The experts reviewing the
three Math A exams "didn't find any problems," Mr. Mills
said. "But when the data began to come in, it seemed clear
that the exam was not behaving as it did the year before.
That was the key." 
<p>
And so on June 24, one week after the exam, Mr. Mills
announced that that he would set aside the results because
the test appeared unfair, and he would ask a panel of
outside experts to assess what went wrong. <p>

While some see the attention to standards as a passing fad,
Mr. Mills argues otherwise. He reads from a speech by New
York's first education commissioner, Andrew Draper,
delivered in 1912: "There will have to be standards here,
and they will have to be upheld, even though the powerful
would break them down." 
<p>
Mr. Mills could have been speaking about Ann Cook,
co-chairwoman of the New York Performance Standards
Consortium, a group of 32 schools around the state that
favor other means of assessment over the Regents exams. Ms.
Cook said the commissioner "has been unwilling to let
schools that were working well continue what they were
doing." 
<p>
"One size does not fit all," she said. "What's necessary at
the very least is a moratorium on the high-stakes testing."

<p>
Although his father spent time as a teacher before entering
the insurance business, Mr. Mills said he did not think
about becoming an educator until his freshman year at
Middlebury College in Vermont, when his English teacher
called him to the front of the classroom to speak about a
poem. He does not remember the poem, but remembers the
experience vividly. <p>

"I suddenly realized how exciting it was to lead the
class," he said. <p>

He thought he would become a history professor. But after
completing a master's degree in history at Columbia
University, he began teaching at the Dalton School, a
private school in Manhattan. <p>

He went on to create an alternative school with other
Dalton teachers and found he liked administration more than
teaching. He returned to Columbia for an M.B.A. from the
business school and a doctorate at Teachers College. Then
he entered education administration in New Jersey, later
moving to Vermont and then to New York. 
<p>
Some critics say that while standards are good, students at
poor schools with unqualified teachers have little chance
of meeting them and should not be penalized. But Mr. Mills
argues that the education they receive will not change
until people see how bad their scores are. <p>

"The Regents, by setting standards and administering tests,
have built pressure that has produced change in the right
direction," he said. "When people say, `The standards are
great, but I don't like this testing regimen,' that's
really an attack on the standards. 
<p>
"None of that is to deny that we have to fix this
particular exam," he continued. "But we are not going to
allow a problem with one exam to overturn the entire
enterprise."
