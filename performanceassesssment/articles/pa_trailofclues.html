	<B>Trail of Clues Preceded</b><p>

By MICHAEL WINERIP <br>
New York Times<br>
October 15, 2003<p>

IN recent years, as New York introduced its new exams
required for high school graduation, there were many signs
of trouble in the state testing program. <p>

In 2001, teachers complained that the scoring on the new
Regents biology and earth science tests was too easy. In
2002, they complained that the scoring on the new physics
test was too hard. Physics students tend to be the
brightest in the state, and typically 15 percent had failed
the old state test; 40 percent failed the new physics test.<p>


Superintendents complained that there was no consistency.
In Rye, a wealthy suburb, 79 percent of students scored at
mastery level (85 percent or higher) on the state English
test, 75 percent on the state history test, and 3 percent
on physics. Even when many districts refused to give the
new physics test and the state superintendents' association
wrote colleges, recommending that they ignore the physics
results, the state education commissioner, Dr. Richard P.
Mills, would not budge. <p>

Dr. Mills, one of the leading advocates of such testing in
the nation, kept issuing upbeat news releases, saying his
testing program was "statistically sound" and "in
accordance with nationally accepted standards." <p>

People who should have known better were fooled. New York's
testing program was one of the first approved by the
federal government under No Child Left Behind. In the
spring, a survey of testing programs by Princeton Review
ranked New York first of the 50 states. "Mills was hard
core" about testing, said Steven Hodas of Princeton Review.
"He had a take-no-prisoners attitude," he said. <p>

No more. In June, it all came crashing down when the scores
on the state Math A exam required for graduation were
released. Two-thirds of students had failed and the outcry
was so great that Dr. Mills had to dump the results and
rescale the test. Then came news that a record 47 percent
had failed the June 2003 physics test and that test too has
to be rescaled. <p>

Now the experts are looking at New York differently. "I'm
stunned," said Mr. Hodas. "Frankly, I thought they were
professionals." He said Princeton Review was doing a major
overhaul of its rating standards. "We're going to have to
come up with a fiasco index for a state like New York that
messes up a lot of people's lives for no reason," he said. <p>

What went wrong? The answer came last week from a special
panel of math and testing experts appointed by Dr. Mills to
investigate. The panel's short answer is that New York's
testing program did not meet national standards and was not
statistically sound. <p>

To develop a test with a dependable pass/fail ratio first
requires extensive field testing of sample exams to gauge
the difficulty of each question, plus the exam as a whole.
And yet, the panel found, the state ignored the most basic
testing guidelines. To prepare the math exam properly,
1,500 students should have been sampled in field tests, the
panel said; only 250 were. <p>

For field testing to be reliable, the panel noted, it must
be conducted under conditions that simulate the stress of
actual testing; the state field testing was done with
students who knew it did not count and often did not bother
to answer hard questions. The result? "New York State can't
accurately predict performance on Math A," the report said.<p>


The panel found the test was developed "on the cheap," with
inadequate staff. The state has one testing expert with a
30-member staff to oversee 70 tests, said Dr. William J.
Brosnan, the panel chairman and Northport schools
superintendent. "The staff had to generate one document per
person per day," Dr. Brosnan said. "You can't expect people
to perform under those conditions." <p>

The panel found so much staff turnover that no one remained
from 1998, when the Math A test was created. "No one knew
the most basic information about the development of the
test," Dr. Brosnan said. <p>

To compensate, the state hired consultants, but the panel
found their work questionable. The consultants' report on
the field tests should have been submitted three months
before the exam to allow for adjustments, Dr. Brosnan said.
"To this day we haven't seen the consultants' report," he
said. "When we called to ask, we were told by the
consultant that the individuals no longer worked there. It
raised confidence issues." <p>

Before items were included on the test, they were supposed
to be approved by a state panel of teachers, but four items
in the June exam were added at the end, without consulting
those teachers. "Several of those items were poorly worded,
confusing and answered incorrectly by large numbers of
students," Dr. Brosnan said. <p>

When the high failure rate became public, state officials
suggested that it was because many weaker students who had
previously failed the math test had taken it again in June
2003. But when the panel compared results from the
strongest students taking the test, ninth graders, they
found that this group scored 18 points lower than the ninth
graders who took the June 2002 Math A test. "We were
surprised the fluctuation was that bad," Dr. Brosnan said. <p>

The state also did a poor job informing teachers how to
prepare for the test. The panel found that state standards
were too vague to be useful. With 103 subjects to be
mastered for a 35-item test, Dr. Brosnan said, "teachers
felt pressed to go a mile wide and an inch deep." Seeing a
trigonometry standard, teachers spent weeks on the subject,
Dr. Brosnan said. "And then there was not a single trig
question. Teachers felt betrayed and kids were let down."
The panel recommended completely rewriting the math
standards. <p>

At the Regents board meeting last week, Dr. Mills said most
recommendations would be quickly carried out. For the first
time, he acknowledged that the physics test needed to be
rescaled, but wanted to limit it to future tests. The board
disagreed, voting to make the rescaling retroactive to the
June 2002 test. "If there's an error," said Lorraine
Cortes-Vazquez, a regent, "it's important for children to
know, that we, as adults, will admit it and correct it."<p>
