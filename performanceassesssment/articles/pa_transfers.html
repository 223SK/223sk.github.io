	<B>New York City's Schools Fear a Wave of Transfers</b><p>

By ELISSA GOOTMAN<br>
New York Times<br>
September 30, 2003<p>

New York City school officials, already struggling with
overcrowding as a result of transfers from failing schools,
are looking for ways to avoid giving thousands more
students the opportunity to transfer this year. 
<p>
Under the new federal No Child Left Behind act, the city is
supposed to let students in failing schools move to better
ones. Already this year about 8,000 students have chosen to
transfer, causing class sizes to balloon in some of the
city's better performing middle schools. 
<p>
A new wave of transfers could be coming. On the third day
of school, 43 additional schools that receive federal
poverty money were labeled as failing to meet standards. If
the city responds to the new federal law this fall the way
it did last spring, thousands of new students would be
eligible to move. 
<p>
City officials say such movement would be disruptive to
both the schools and the students, and education officials
are now examining the federal law to see whether it allows
other remedies. One alternative being considered is
offering students tutoring instead of transfers. 
<p>
"We're weighing the alternatives at this point and have not
been able to come to a decision on exactly what options to
follow at this juncture," said Peter Kerr, a spokesman for
the city's Department of Education. 
<p>
New York has gone further than many other school systems in
following the federal law. In Chicago, 19,000 students
requested transfers from failing schools but only 1,100
were allowed to move, apparently without the city suffering
sanctions. 
<p>
In New York, officials said no transfer requests were
rejected, although the 8,000 who chose to transfer were
only a small part of the roughly 300,000 students in 315
schools who were eligible. 
<p>
Some children's advocates believe that many parents did not
know about the transfer option last school year or
misunderstood how it worked, and that more parents would
pursue transfers if they are offered again this school
year. 
<p>
Faced with that prospect, city officials were considering
what to do when they noticed a recent statement by the
federal education secretary, Rod Paige, that seemed to
offer some solutions. 
<p>
In an online chat with educators, Dr. Paige was asked what
could be done for students who would like to transfer when
a district's high-performing schools are at capacity. In
his response, as in other recent public remarks, Dr. Paige
was less clear-cut about the matter than he had been in the
past. 
<p>
"The school district can come up with innovative ways to
meet the students' needs," Dr. Paige responded. "They can
use supplemental services sooner, can create charter
schools, and can create schools inside of schools. They can
even use technology to provide choices and options for
students. The district can also work with other nearby
districts to provide more options to parents. All of these
choices can be accomplished by effectively utilizing Title
I funds. The bottom line is these students need extra
assistance to attain the education they deserve." 
<p>
Mr. Kerr said Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein and the
department's lawyers "have taken into account the
secretary's comments and are looking at all options so that
the school system will fully comply with the law but also
will take into account the needs of the many children
affected by No Child Left Behind." 
<p>
"Some of the factors that are under consideration are the
capacities of the schools which would receive transfers,
the disruptive nature of transfers during the middle of the
school year, and the ability to provide appropriate choices
to students and their families going forward," Mr. Kerr
said, adding, "We are very concerned about the disruptive
nature of transfers on a school system where there may be
limited capacity to absorb more transfers in midyear in
some grades." 
<p>
Some officials have questioned why New York City made such
an effort to comply with the transfer provision. 
<p>
In Chicago, for example, transfers were only offered to
1,100 of the 19,000 students who applied because "we refuse
to overcrowd schools," said Joi M. Mecks, a spokeswoman for
the Chicago public schools. "Any school, regardless of how
well the school is doing, if they get an influx of
students, there's definitely some things that have to be
adjusted." 
<p>
In New York, Randi Weingarten, president of the United
Federation of Teachers, suggested the city was trying hard
to show compliance with the law for political reasons. 
<p>
"Unlike Chicago, in New York you had a Republican mayor who
was trying to get the Republican convention and was trying
to show that they were being more compliant with No Child
Left Behind than anywhere else," Ms. Weingarten said. 
<p>
In a telephone interview, Dan Langan, a spokesman for the
federal Education Department, echoed Dr. Paige's remarks,
saying that when the department advised state and local
districts with capacity problems, it discussed a variety of
acceptable programs that can be considered "choices," from
transfers to distance learning. He said the counseling did
not reflect a change in policy. "That's the guidance the
Department of Education has offered for some time," he
said. 
<p>
City and state education officials seemed surprised,
though. Eva S. Moskowitz, chairwoman of the City Council's
Education Committee, said the notion that large school
districts could deny parents transfers in favor of other
remedies "appears to be a step backwards from their earlier
commitments." 
<p>
She said that she believed the city was obligated to allow
students to transfer from schools deemed to be failing, but
that she would not insist the city do this in the middle of
the school year. 
<p>
"It's awfully inconvenient that the state announces these
things in the middle of the year, but I would say that at a
minimum they need to offer parents a choice in January or
February at the latest for the following September," Ms.
Moskowitz said. 
<p>
Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who is
chairman of the Assembly's Education Committee, said the
State Education Department had taken the position that
students in the 43 newly listed schools in need of
improvement must be allowed to transfer this school year. 
<p>
"I've heard that the city is not convinced that they are
required to offer parental choice in the first year," Mr.
Sanders said.
