	<B>Test Travesty: Schools Should Emphasize Learning, Not Testing</b><p>

Houston Chronicle Editorial<br>
April 30, 2004<p>


Advising students that the answer to any question on the American
Revolution is likely to be George Washington bears not even a slight
resemblance to teaching. Yet more than one teacher defends the practice
of suggesting answers without context in lieu of teaching the subject.
<p>
Chronicle columnist Rick Casey revealed and disparaged this dispiriting
custom in an April 25 commentary after a substitute teacher showed him
the regular teacher's Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills review
sheet. The sheet listed key historical names, dates and other facts for
students to memorize and then regurgitate on test day.
<p>
At first impression, this is teaching at its worst. Upon greater
reflection, this effort to raise test scores without learning is
education accountability at its worst.
<p>
In a subsequent Casey column, the anonymous teacher who devised the list
of answers without questions for students at his affluent Houston-area
school said the high-stakes nature of the test demoralizes teachers and
forces them to employ methods they otherwise would not use. He expressed
disappointment that the community at large prizes high marks over
painstaking learning.
<p>
Ideally, educators would teach students to master the Texas core
curriculum so they could pass the TAKS. The statewide test is supposed
to demonstrate how well schoolchildren have learned the material, not
whether they have acquired tricks to increase their score on multiple
choice tests without increasing their knowledge.
<p>
Instead, students are drilled in all manner of test-taking strategies.
They are drilled and reviewed to within inches of their lives for days
or weeks on end. Practice tests and drills supplant time that should be
spent learning content.
<p>
Teachers frequently decry public policies, such as alternative
certification programs, that do not respect the professionalism of their
occupation. They should demonstrate that professionalism by refusing to
waste valuable instructional time on rote exercises that bore eager
learners and risk killing all hope of instilling intellectual curiosity
in the rest of the class.
<p>
However, teachers can't work miracles. Parents have to act as partners
in their children's education, demanding high academic standards instead
of just high grades that boost odds of acceptance at college but do
nothing to help students fare well once they get there. And school
administrators must change the school environment from one in which
standardized testing is all-important.
<p>
Should that happen, teachers will be able to do the job they were hired
to do, so students can learn what they need to know to pass the tests.
