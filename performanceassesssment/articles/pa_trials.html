	<B>Trials of Regents Test Foresaw Failure at a High Rate</b><p>

By KAREN W. ARENSON<br>
New York Times<br>
August 27, 2003<p>

A preliminary report on the problems with a statewide math
test needed for graduation from high school in New York
State has found that even early trials of the test
indicated that the average student would be unable to pass.<p>

But the test, known as Math A, was nonetheless administered
in June across the state, causing thousands of students to
fail to meet the requirements for a Regents diploma. <p>

After a wide outcry, state education officials set aside
the results for high school juniors and seniors. 
<p>
The report, by a panel of outside math teachers, school
officials and other experts, recommended that scores for
younger students, most in the eighth, ninth and tenth
grades, should be revised upward. State officials said that
they would begin work on raising the scores, which could
affect the students' placement in future classes as well as
their college admissions. <p>

Although the panel is not scheduled to issue its final
report until October, the interim report, released
yesterday, highlighted a number of issues it plans to study
further: <p>

The June test was "substantially more difficult" than the
test a year earlier, as many students and teachers had
claimed. <p>

A string of especially tough problems partway through the
test appeared to frustrate some students, who simply gave
up on the exam. <p>

Based on field tests before the actual test was
administered, the Education Department expected the average
score on the June test to be 46. The expected average for
the test given a year earlier was 51 - slightly higher, but
still below the score needed to pass, which is 65 for
students who entered ninth grade in 2001 or later, and 55
for everyone else. <p>

Trigonometry, which was part of the state's Math A
syllabus and of previous tests, was not included among the
35 questions on the test. But there were three items that
used the Pythagorean theorem, leaving any students who were
weak in that area at a disadvantage. <p>

Dr. William Brosnan, superintendent of schools in the
Northport-East Northport School District on Long Island,
and chairman of the 13-member math panel, said that some of
the findings had surprised the committee, and that there
were many significant questions left to answer. <p>

"Is there a mismatch between where we are setting the
standards and where average students are falling?" Dr.
Brosnan asked. "And if so, is it the result of a curriculum
problem, a staff training problem, or that the testing
standards are simply too tough? It is fair to say that our
initial work raises some red flags." 
<p>
He said that while the panel was just digging into those
issues, it wanted to deliver a preliminary recommendation
on scoring now so that students could be placed in
appropriate classes to start the school year. 
<p>
Asked why the Education Department gave a test when it
expected the average score to be so low, Alan Ray, a
department spokesman, said, "The purpose of the test is to
measure whether students meet the standards, not to make
sure that a certain number of students pass or fail." 
<p>
The state still does not know how many students took the
June 2003 Math A exam, or how many students failed it. But
a preliminary survey of school districts by the Education
Department in June found that only about 37 percent of the
students who took the 35-question test passed. 
<p>
The interim report and the Education Department's response
drew praise yesterday. 
<p>
Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a New York City Democrat and
chairman of the Assembly's Education Committee, said that
some of the panel's findings were astonishing. 
<p>
"The panel has confirmed the worst fears that have been
expressed about high-stakes exams for a number of years,"
he said. <p>

He said that the Legislature, which had planned to conduct
hearings on the Regents exam system late this summer, now
plans to hold them in October, after the math committee's
full report has been released. <p>

Merryl H. Tisch, a Regent from New York City who has
questioned whether the Regents exams are performing
appropriately, said she was pleased with the panel's
"thorough report" - and with the State Education
Department's response. <p>

"The good news is that the State Education Department
showed that it could have a nimble response to a serious
problem," she said. "The other part that is encouraging is
that the panel is asking very serious policy questions,
like whether the exam is supposed to be at a level that is
so difficult that it competes with achievement tests or
whether it is supposed to display competency at the end of
a course." <p>

The New York City schools chancellor's office released a
statement saying that it supported the State Education
Department's decision to revise the scores. <p>

Although it is too early to say how much the scores are
likely to rise, the education department said that no
scores would be reduced. The math committee has recommended
a complicated approach that effectively will compare the
ninth grade test results this year and last, and then raise
this year's ninth grade scores so they will appear similar
to last year's ninth grade scores - and will adjust other
scores to match those. <p>

The report said that this year's ninth graders scored
almost 10 points lower than those in June 2002.
