	<B>Citing Flaw, New York State Voids Math Scores</B><p>

By SAM DILLON    <br>
New York Times<br>
June 25, 2003<P>
 
Moving to defuse a crisis for thousands of high school
students, New York State's education commissioner, Richard
P. Mills, yesterday set aside the results of last week's
Math A Regents exam for seniors and juniors. The test is
required for graduation, and many educators had described
it as inordinately difficult. <p>

Mr. Mills's decision, which came after four days of rising
clamor from principals, parents, lawmakers and members of
the Board of Regents, allows local school authorities
across New York to issue diplomas to seniors who failed the
test but passed their math courses, and to certify that
juniors who failed have passed the math graduation
requirements. Sophomores and freshmen who failed may have
to retake the test, although their scores may be adjusted
upward after authorities complete an investigation. <p>

Mr. Mills acknowledged that the test was technically
flawed, but declined to say whether its defect lay in the
phrasing of its questions, the level at which its passing
score was set, or in some other feature. <p>

"I think we made some mistakes with this exam, and it's up
to us to identify and correct them," Mr. Mills said. Early
results of a survey by the State Department of Education
showed that only about 37 percent of the students who took
the test on June 17 scored at or above the passing level of
55, compared with 61 percent in June 2002. <p>

Educators said it was the first time that test results had
been scrapped since the commissioner and the Board of
Regents in 1996 began converting the Regents tests from a
battery of optional tests taken to achieve higher honors
into graduation requirements for all New York students. <p>

Mr. Mills's predecessor, Thomas Sobol, could recall only
one time in the 80-year history of Regents testing that
results had been set aside - and that was when a newspaper
published a stolen answer sheet before the test was given.
One State Education Department official, however, said he
believed other results might have been set aside. <p>

Mr. Mills made his decision in close consultation with
Robert M. Bennett, the retired president of the United Way
of Buffalo and Erie County, who is chancellor of the Board
of Regents. Mr. Bennett said that all 16 members of the
board had come to consensus in a series of phone calls on
Sunday and Monday on the need to set aside the results. <p>

"This was a moment of embarrassment," Mr. Bennett said. "We
heard big-time from parents, who got very upset about their
kids' education, which I think is a good thing - so lesson
learned, but more to come. We're not finished with this." <p>

Mr. Mills said he was appointing an independent panel of
mathematicians and others to review what went wrong. In the
meantime, he also announced the suspension of the next
administration of the Math A Regents, scheduled for August,
to give testing experts time to rectify problems identified
by the panel. <p>

The emergency decision came just in time for thousands of
seniors who had failed the exam, because graduation
ceremonies are scheduled for this week at many of the
state's 1,000 high schools. Since passing the exam was a
prerequisite for graduation, many schools had to consider
whether to allow those who had failed to participate in the
ceremonies. <p>

On the test, students were given three hours to answer 335
questions, which ranged across concepts of algebra,
geometry, probability and statistics. The test is intended
to be administered to students at the end of their
sophomore year, but advanced students can elect to take it
as freshmen, and students who have failed it can try
repeatedly to pass it. <p>

One of Mr. Mills's deputy commissioners, James A. Kadamus,
said that the results of a preliminary survey conducted in
recent days had provided data that resists any quick
diagnosis of the test's basic problem, especially since
students seem to have performed at different proficiencies
depending on their grade levels. In the sample results
gathered in the survey, 30 percent of the seniors had
passed the test, compared with 27 percent of juniors, 48
percent of sophomores and 81 percent of freshmen, Mr.
Kadamus said. <p>

One interpretation of this data was that the freshmen and
sophomores who took the test were generally stronger math
performers, while the juniors and seniors were students who
struggle, Mr. Kadamus said. <p>

A significant percentage of students appear to have simply
given up after struggling with about half the test. "One
possibility we're looking at is that there was something
about the accumulation of questions which caused greater
difficulty than the individual questions," Mr. Kadamus
said. "The whole was greater than the sum of the parts. So
it looks like there was a discouragement factor." <p>

One student who experienced that discouragement was Joey
Morgan, a sophomore at Putnam Valley High School in Putnam
County, who took the test for the fourth time on June 17.
"Parts 1 and 2 were fair, but on Parts 3 and 4 it was like
- Whoa! I've never seen anything like this," Mr. Morgan
said, adding that he believed he had failed, but had not
been officially notified. <p>

Not all students failed the test. At the Benjamin Banneker
Academy in Brooklyn, a dozen seniors who needed to pass the
test to graduate attended after-school and Saturday morning
tutoring sessions all spring - and all 12 passed the test,
Daryl Rock, the school's principal said. <p>

"When I was taking the exam, I kept saying to myself, `Oh
my God, this is too hard,' " said Kimberly Boone, an
18-year-old senior, who had failed the test three times. <p>

She earned a 73 on the test, the highest in her class at
Banneker. "Tears came to my eyes I was so happy," she said.<p>


Mr. Mills's decision brought praise from some education
officials. <p>

"The commissioner believes in standards to his core - he is
Mr. Standards - and he saw that this was a flawed test and
rather than making excuses he took quick, decisive action,"
said Randi Weingarten, president of the city teachers'
union. "I give him a lot of credit for that." <p>

Steven Sanders, the chairman of the Education Committee in
the State Assembly, who has been critical of the decision
to transform the Regents tests into a graduation
requirement, congratulated Mr. Mills for his decision, but
added: "This is an opportunity to now revisit and
reconsider the policy of high-stakes, do-or-die exams.
Exclusive reliance on any particular exam on any given day
is an inherently flawed process." <p>

But Joel I. Klein, the New York City chancellor, who said
he called yesterday to congratulate Mr. Mills, argued that
the debacle on the Math A test should not be interpreted as
a blow to the standards movement. "This is not to eliminate
testing," Mr. Klein said. "This is to eliminate a test that
was way out of line."
