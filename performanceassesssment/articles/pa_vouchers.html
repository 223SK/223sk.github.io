	<B>What Some Much-Noted Data Really Showed About Vouchers</B><p>

By MICHAEL WINERIP <br>
New York Times<br>
May 7, 2003<P>
 
In August of 2000, in the midst of the Bush-Gore
presidential race, a Harvard professor, Paul E. Peterson,
released a study saying that school vouchers significantly
improved test scores of black children. Professor Peterson
had conducted the most ambitious randomized experiment on
vouchers to date, and his results - showing that blacks
using vouchers to attend private schools had scored six
percentile points higher than a control group of blacks in
public schools - became big news. <P>

The Harvard professor appeared on CNN and "The NewsHour
With Jim Lehrer." Conservative editorial writers and
columnists, including William Safire of The Times, cited
the Peterson study as proof that vouchers were the answer
for poor blacks, that Al Gore (a voucher opponent) was out
of touch with his black Democratic constituency and that
George W. Bush had it right. <P>

"The facts are clear and persuasive: school vouchers work,"
The Boston Herald editorialized on Aug. 30, 2000. "If
candidates looked at facts, this one would be a no-brainer
for Gore." <P>

Then, three weeks later, Professor Peterson's partner in
the study, Mathematica, a Princeton-based research firm,
issued a sharp dissent. Mathematica's report emphasized
that all the gains in Professor Peterson's experiment,
conducted in New York City, had come in just one of the
five grades studied, the sixth, and that the rest of the
black pupils, as well as Latinos and whites of all grades
who used vouchers, had shown no gains. Since there was no
logical explanation for this, Mathematica noted the chance
of a statistical fluke. "Because gains are so concentrated
in this single group, one needs to be very cautious," it
said. <P>

Several newspapers wrote about Mathematica's report, but,
coming three weeks after the first round of articles, these
did not have the same impact. <P>

And Professor Peterson, a big voucher supporter, continued,
undaunted. His 2002 book, "The Education Gap," largely
ignored Mathematica's concerns and ballyhooed voucher gains
for blacks. "The switch to a private school had
significantly positive impacts on the test scores of
African-American students," he wrote. <P>

While he still couldn't explain why only blacks had gained,
he offered theories. Perhaps heavily black public schools
were even worse than urban Latino or white schools. Or,
since most vouchers in New York were used in Catholic
schools, perhaps a religious "missionary commitment is
required to create a positive educational environment" for
blacks. <P>

David Myers, the lead researcher for Mathematica, is
hesitant to criticize Professor Peterson. ("I'm going to be
purposely vague on that," he said in an interview.) But he
did something much more decent and important. After many
requests from skeptical academics, he agreed to make the
entire database for the New York voucher study available to
independent researchers. <P>

A Princeton economist, Alan B. Krueger, took the offer, and
after two years recently concluded that Professor Peterson
had it all wrong - that not even the black students using
vouchers had made any test gains. And Mr. Myers, Professor
Peterson's former research partner, agrees, calling
Professor Krueger's work "a fine interpretation of the
results." <P>

What makes this a cautionary tale for political leaders
seeking to draft public policy from supposedly scientific
research is the mundane nature of the apparent
miscalculations. Professor Krueger concluded that the
original study had failed to count 292 black students whose
test scores should have been included. And once they are
added - making the sample larger and statistically more
reliable - vouchers appear to have made no difference for
any group. <P>

Some background. In 1997, 20,000 New York City students
each applied for a $1,400 voucher to private school through
a project financed by several foundations. A total of 1,300
were selected by lottery to get a voucher, and 1,300 others
- the controls, who had wanted a voucher but were not
selected - were tracked in public schools. When the first
test results came back, the vouchers made no difference in
test scores for the 2,600 students as a whole. So the
original researchers tried breaking the group down by
ethnicity and race, and that's when they noted the
sixth-grade test gains for the black voucher group. <P>

But there was a problem. The original researchers had never
planned to break out students by race. As a result, their
definition of race was not well thought out: it depended
solely on the mother. In their data, a child with a black
mother and a white father was counted as black; a child
with a white mother and a black father was counted as
white. <P>

When the father's race is considered, 78 more blacks are
added to the sample. Professor Krueger also found that 214
blacks had been unnecessarily eliminated from the results
because of incomplete background data. These corrections by
Professor Krueger expanded the total number of blacks in
the sample by 292, to 811 from 519. <P>

In recent weeks, Mr. Myers, of Mathematica, has reviewed
Professor Krueger's critique and found it impressive. Mr.
Myers has now concluded that Professor Krueger's
adjustments mean that "the impact of a voucher offer is not
statistically significant." <P>

It is scary how many prominent thinkers in this nation of
290 million were ready to make new policy from a single
study that appears to have gone from meaningful to
meaningless based on whether 292 children's test scores are
discounted or included. "It's not a study I'd want to use
to make public policy," Mr. Myers said. "I see this and go
`whoa.' " <P>

Professor Krueger of Princeton (who also writes a monthly
business column in The Times) said, "This appeared to be
high-quality work, but it teaches you not to believe
anything until the data are made available." <P>

As for Professor Peterson of Harvard, the star of
newspapers and TV news in 2000 remains curiously mum these
days. In a brief interview, he declined to comment on
Professor Krueger's or Mathematica's criticisms. He said he
stood by his conclusion that vouchers lifted black scores,
and would "eventually" respond in a "technical paper." But
he said he would not discuss these matters with a reporter.<P>


"It's not appropriate," he said, "to talk about complex
methodologies in the news media."
