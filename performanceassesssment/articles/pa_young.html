	<B>Young, Jobless, Hopeless</B><p>

By BOB HERBERT <br>
The New York Times <br>
February 6, 2003<P>
 

CHICAGO - You see them in many parts of the city, hanging
out on frigid street corners, skylarking at the malls or
bowling alleys, hustling for money wherever they can,
drifting in some cases into the devastating clutches of
drug-selling, gang membership, prostitution and worse. 
<p>
In Chicago there are nearly 100,000 young people, ages 16
to 24, who are out of work, out of school and all but out
of hope. In New York City there are more than 200,000.
Nationwide, according to a new study by a team from
Northeastern University in Boston, the figure is a
staggering 5.5 million and growing. 
<p>
This army of undereducated, jobless young people,
disconnected in most instances from society's mainstream,
is restless and unhappy, and poses a severe long-term
threat to the nation's well-being on many fronts. 
<p>
Audrey Roberts, a 17-year-old who just recently landed a
job at a fast-food restaurant on Chicago's West Side,
talked to me about some of the experiences she and her
out-of-work friends have had to endure. 
<p>
"The stuff you hear about on the news," she said, "that's
our everyday life. I've seen girls get raped, beaten up. I
saw a boy get his head blown away. That happened right in
front of me. I said, 'Oh my God!' I just stood there." 
<p>
The shooting was over a dice game that was being played one
afternoon by boys who had nothing better to do with their
time, she said. 
<p>
It's an article of faith among politicians and members of
the media that the recession we continue to experience is a
mild one. But it has hit broad sections of the nation's
young people with a ferocity that has left many of them
stunned. 
<p>
"I don't think I can take it much longer," said Angjell
Brackins, a 19-year-old South Side resident. "I get up in
the morning. I take a bath. I put on my clothes. I go
outside." 
<p>
She has tried for months to find a job, she said, filling
out application after application, to no avail. "I'll do
any kind of work if they'll just hire me. It doesn't
matter, as long as it's a job." 
<p>
The report from Northeastern, titled "Left Behind in the
Labor Market," found that joblessness among out-of-school
youths between 16 and 24 had surged by 12 percent since the
year 2000. Washington's mindless response to this
burgeoning crisis has been to slash - and in some cases
eliminate - the few struggling programs aimed at bolstering
youth employment and training. 
<p>
Education and career decisions made during the late teens
and early 20's are crucial to the lifetime employment and
earnings prospects of an individual. Those who do not do
well during this period seldom catch up to the rest of the
population. 
<p>
"Our ability to generate family stability and safe
communities is strongly influenced by this," said Dr.
Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies
at Northeastern and the lead author of the study. 
<p>
When you have 5 1/2 million young people wandering around
without diplomas, without jobs and without prospects, you
might as well hand them T-shirts to wear that say "We're
Trouble." 
<p>
Without help, they will not become part of a skilled work
force. And they will become a drain on the nation's
resources. One way or another, the rest of us will end up
supporting them. 
<p>
"It's just heartbreaking," said Jack Wuest, who runs the
Alternative Schools Network in Chicago, which commissioned
the study. "These kids need a fair shake and they're not
getting it." 
<p>
The Bush administration, committed to a war with Iraq and
obsessed with tax cuts for the wealthy, has no interest in
these youngsters. And very few others in a position to help
are willing to go to bat for them. 
<p>
In a long series of conversations with young unemployed and
undereducated Chicagoans, I did not hear much of anything
in the way of aspirations. Whether boys or girls, men or
women, those who were interviewed seemed for the most part
already defeated. They did not talk about finding the
perfect job. They did not talk about being in love and
eventually marrying and raising a family. They did not
express a desire to someday own their own home. 
<p>
There was, to tell the truth, a remarkable absence of
positive comments and emotions of any kind. There was a
widespread sense of frustration, and some anger. But mostly
there was just sadness.
