	<B>The 'Zero Dropout' Miracle: Alas! Alack! A Texas Tall Tale</b><p>

By MICHAEL WINERIP <br>
New York Times<br>
August 13, 2003<p>


HOUSTON <p>

ROBERT KIMBALL, an assistant principal at Sharpstown High
School, sat smack in the middle of the "Texas miracle." His
poor, mostly minority high school of 1,650 students had a
freshman class of 1,000 that dwindled to fewer than 300
students by senior year. And yet - and this is the miracle
- not one dropout to report! <p>

Nor was zero an unusual dropout rate in this school
district that both President Bush and Secretary of
Education Rod Paige have held up as the national showcase
for accountability and the model for the federal No Child
Left Behind law. Westside High here had 2,308 students and
no reported dropouts; Wheatley High 731 students, no
dropouts. A dozen of the city's poorest schools reported
dropout rates under 1 percent. <p>

Now, Dr. Kimball has witnessed many amazing things in his
58 years. Before he was an educator, he spent 24 years in
the Army, fighting in Vietnam, rising to the rank of
lieutenant colonel and touring the world. But never had he
seen an urban high school with no dropouts. "Impossible,"
he said. "Someone will get pregnant, go to jail, get
killed." Elsewhere in the nation, urban high schools report
dropout rates of 20 percent to 40 percent. <p>

A miracle? "A fantasy land," said Dr. Kimball. "They want
the data to look wonderful and exciting. They don't tell
you how to do it; they just say, 'Do it.' " In February,
with the help of Dr. Kimball, the local television station
KHOU broke the news that Sharpstown High had falsified its
dropout data. That led to a state audit of 16 Houston
schools, which found that of 5,500 teenagers surveyed who
had left school, 3,000 should have been counted as dropouts
but were not. Last week, the state appointed a monitor to
oversee the district's data collection and downgraded 14
audited schools to the state's lowest rating. <p>

Not very miraculous sounding, but here is the intriguing
question: How did it get to the point that veteran
principals felt they could actually claim zero dropouts?
"You need to understand the atmosphere in Houston," Dr.
Kimball said. "People are afraid. The superintendent has
frequent meetings with principals. Before they go in, the
principals are really, really scared. Panicky. They have to
make their numbers." <p>

Pressure? Some compare it to working under the old Soviet
system of five-year plans. In January, just before the
scandal broke, Abelardo Saavedra, deputy superintendent,
unveiled Houston's latest mandates for the new year. "The
districtwide student attendance rate will increase from
94.6 percent to 95 percent," he wrote. "The districtwide
annual dropout rate will decrease from 1.5 percent to 1.3
percent." <p>

Dropouts are notoriously difficult to track, particularly
at a heavily Latino school like Sharpstown, with immigrants
going back and forth to Mexico. Dr. Kimball said that
Sharpstown shared one truant officer with several schools.
Even so, Houston officials would not allow principals to
write that the whereabouts of a departed student were
"unknown." Last fall, Margaret Stroud, deputy
superintendent, sent a memorandum warning principals to
"make sure that you do not have any students coded `99,'
whereabouts unknown." Too many "unknowns," she wrote, could
prompt a state audit - the last thing Houston leaders
wanted. <p>

A shortage of resources to track departing students? No
"unknowns" allowed? What to do? "Make it up," Dr. Kimball
said. "The principals who survive are the yes men." <p>

As for those who fail to make their numbers, it is
termination time, one of many innovations championed by Dr.
Paige as superintendent here from 1994 to 2001. He got rid
of tenure for principals and mandated that they sign
one-year contracts that allowed dismissal "without cause"
and without a hearing. <p>

On the other hand, for principals who make their numbers,
it is bonus time. Principals can earn a $5,000 bonus,
district administrators up to $20,000. At Sharpstown High
alone, Dr. Kimball said, $75,000 in bonus money was issued
last year, before the fictitious numbers were exposed. <p>

Dr. Paige's spokesman, Dan Langan, referred dropout
questions to Houston officials, but said that the secretary
was proud of the accountability system he established here,
that it got results and that principals freely signed those
contracts. <p>

Terry Abbott, a Houston district spokesman, agreed that
both Dr. Paige and the current superintendent, Kaye
Stripling, pressured principals to make district goals.
"Secretary Paige said, and rightfully so, the public has a
right to expect us to get this job done," Mr. Abbott said.
The principals were not cowed, he said, declaring, "They
thrive on it." Every administrator under Dr. Paige and Dr.
Stripling, Mr. Abbott said, has understood "failure is not
an option" and "that failure to do our jobs can mean that
we could lose those jobs - and that's exactly the way it
should be." <p>

As for adequate resources for truant officers to verify
dropouts, he said individual schools decided how to use
their resources, but added, "Money is not the problem, and
money by itself won't solve the issues we deal with every
day." <p>

To skeptics like Dr. Kimball, the parallels to No Child
Left Behind are depressing. The federal law mandates that
every child in America pass reading and math proficiency
tests by 2014 - a goal many educators believe is as
impossible as zero dropouts. And like Houston's dropout
program, President Bush's education budget has been
criticized as an underfinanced mandate, proposing $12
billion this year for Title 1, $6 billion below what the No
Child Left Behind law permits. "This isn't about educating
children," Dr. Kimball said. "It's about public relations."<p>


If Houston officials were interested in accountability, he
said, they would assign him to a high school to monitor the
dropout data that he has come to understand so well.
Instead, after he blew the whistle on Sharpstown High, he
was reassigned, for four months, to sit in a windowless
room with no work to do. More recently, he has been serving
as the second assistant principal at a primary school,
where, he said, he is not really needed. "I expect when my
contract is up next January, I'll be fired," he said.
"That's how it works here."
