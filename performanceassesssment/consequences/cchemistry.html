<B>Chemistry Joins Physics as a Problem Regents Test</B><br>
By Meryl Hyman Harris<br>Published in The Journal News, June 26, 2002<p>

Frustration with Regents exams intensified yesterday as state officials
acknowledged a problem with the chemistry test grading system, and some
educators decided not to count the physics test toward students' grade-point
averages. 
<p>
Many schools use the tests as final exams that count as much as 20 percent
of the year-end grade.
<p>
In the wake of a high failure rate and of teacher complaints about the
scoring scale on the new physics exam, the state sent a memo to school
superintendents suggesting they not include the test score in the final
average. 
<p>
"Districts are free to change their policy in this instance if they deem it
appropriate," Deputy Education Commissioner James A. Kadamus wrote Friday.
<p>
Officials in Carmel, Chappaqua and other districts said they had jettisoned
the physics exam in setting final grades.
<p>
Briarcliff Manor, on the other hand, notified students that for purposes of
grade-point averaging the exam would be scored again, this time on an easier
curve, said Superintendent Frances Wills.
<p>
Officials in other districts, such as Bedford and South Orangetown, were
waiting for more information from the state Education Department.
<p>
"We would hope that the state would decide to rescale the way the tests were
scored," said Jane Sandbank, South Orangetown's assistant superintendent for
curriculum and instruction. "The teachers were very upset by the exams and
the way they were told to scale the scores."
<p>
Regardless of the individual district's decision, the test score will still
affect the mostly juniors and seniors who took Regents physics. State law
requires that Regents test results be included on report cards and
transcripts used for college applications.
<p>
Saul Cohen of New Rochelle, a member of the state Board of Regents, said
yesterday that state officials were investigating just how low the scores
actually were. 
<p>
"If they do revise the scores, then clearly, they will be revised on some
kind of curve based on the results of the exam," he said, even though the
idea has been to hold all schools to the same standard.
<p>
Chemistry test graders yesterday plied the state with concerns about the
questions, seeking instruction on how to score answers that could be partly
correct. 
<p>
The problem is one of "double jeopardy," in which one wrong calculation
forces wrong answers on other questions, even though the student clearly
understands the material, said Chappaqua science chairman Richard Goodman.
<p>
"It's not as bad as the physics test," he said. "But they leave such wide
variation for interpreting what's right and wrong and what's double
jeopardy." 
<p>
He said he was concerned that while some teachers would be told individually
how to score certain answers, the state might not issue "errata" reports for
all graders. 
<p>
"What will happen is the assistant superintendent will get a fax from the
state Education Department, who will disseminate it to the department
chairman, who will disseminate it to teachers so we can go back and
rescore," he said, but with school out this week, "we aren't going to be
available." 
<p>
A spokesman for the State Department of Education confirmed last night that
teachers grading the exam had found instances in which students should be
given partial credit.
<p>
The correct scoring procedure would be disseminated electronically last
night to science teachers and supervisors, said Tom Dunn. It is a matter of
two points on the exam, he said.
<p>
"We'll make every effort to make sure the critical people have the
information necessary to complete transcripts and report cards," he said.
