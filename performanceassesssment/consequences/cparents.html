<B>Parent Survey Report<br>

<I>Findings May, 2007</I></B><p>

In an effort to gauge parent satisfaction with their child’s school, its system of assessment, and its method of communication, the New York Performance Standards Consortium (NYPSC) conducted a survey of parents whose children attend Consortium schools. Consortium schools use a system of performance-based assessment in lieu of high stakes Regents exams to determine readiness for graduation. A total of 842 surveys were analyzed. Where applicable, responses were compared with data presented in a 2006 Gallup poll regarding public opinion of the nation’s public schools.<p>

Consortium data compared with Gallup poll:<ul>

    <li> While the Gallup poll found that 64% of public school parents polled nationally assigned their child’s school an A or B, an overwhelming majority of Consortium parents (86.2%) felt their child’s school deserved an A or a B. <p>

    <li> The Gallup poll found that 50% of parents polled nationally believed that the curriculum of their child’s school needed to be changed compared with only 10.5% of Consortium respondents. <p>

    <li> Interestingly, only 8.1% of Consortium parents and 17% of Gallup respondents believed the percentage of students passing state tests was a better measure than improvements shown by students during the school year when measuring the performance of their child's school.<p>
</ul>
Parent satisfaction with communication from child’s school:<ul>

    <li> 92.5% of Consortium parents believed that the communication they received from their child’s school had been clear and easy to understand.<br>
    <li> 90.6% of parents stated that they were satisfied with the level of communication they receive from their child’s school.<br>
    <li> 94.6% of parents felt their child’s school made efforts to communicate with them.<p>
</ul>
Parents’ trust in their children’s teachers was evident: <ul>

    <li> 94.5% of parent respondents felt their child’s teachers cared about their child’s progress.<br>
    <li> 95.0% believed that their child’s teachers have a good idea of their child’s strengths and weaknesses.<br>
    <li> 93.7% preferred teacher assessment of student work and progress compared to 39.4% who trusted testing corporations’ assessments of their child’s progress.<br>
    <li> 90.6% of parents stated that they preferred to read or hear the teacher’s evaluation of their child as opposed to receiving a computer print-out evaluation form (4.3%).<br>
    <li> 92.4% of parents trusted their child’s teacher to prepare them for college-level work.<p>
</ul>
<I>Survey conducted by the Center for Inquiry, New York City<p>
