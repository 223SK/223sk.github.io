<B>More Schools Rely on Tests, but Study Raises Doubts</B><br>
Greg Winter<p>

Rigorous testing that decides whether students graduate,
teachers win bonuses and schools are shuttered, an approach
already in place in more than half the nation, does little
to improve achievement and may actually worsen academic
performance and dropout rates, according to the largest
study ever on the issue. 
<p>
With calls for accountability in public education mounting,
such make-or-break exams have become cornerstones in at
least 28 states in the drive to improve public schools. The
idea is that by tying test scores to great consequences,
the learning process will be taken that much more seriously
and tangible progress will be all the more likely. 
<p>
The approach is also central to some of President Bush's
sweeping education overhaul, lending even greater momentum
to the movement known as "high stakes" testing. 
<p>
But the study, performed by researchers at Arizona State
University and financed by teachers' unions that have
expressed skepticism about such tests, found that while
students show consistent improvement on these state exams,
the opposite is typically true of their performance on
other, independent measures of academic achievement. 
<p>
For example, after adopting such exams, twice as many
states slipped against the national average on the SAT and
the ACT as gained on it. The same held true for
elementary-school math scores on the National Assessment of
Educational Progress, an exam overseen by the United States
Department of Education. 
<p>
Trends on Advanced Placement tests were also worse than the
national average in 57 percent of those states, while
movement in elementary-school reading scores was evenly
split - better than the national average in half the
states, worse in the other half. The only category in which
most of the states gained ground was middle-school math,
with 63 percent of them bettering the national trend. 
<p>
"Teachers are focusing so intently on the high-stakes tests
that they are neglecting other things that are ultimately
more important," said Audrey Amrein, the study's lead
author, who says she supported high-stakes tests before
conducting her research. "In theory, high-stakes tests
should work, because they advance the notions of high
standards and accountability. But students are being
trained so narrowly because of it, they are having a hard
time branching out and understanding general
problem-solving." 
<p>
The study was commissioned by the Great Lakes Center for
Education Research and Practice, a Midwestern group of six
state affiliates of the National Education Association,
which has opposed using any one test to determine when
students graduate, schools get more money and teachers are
replaced. The research is sure to be a subject of fierce
debate among educators, and its methodology has already
drawn some criticism, though an independent panel of
researchers at other universities has concluded that the
findings are valid. 
<p>
Perhaps most controversial, the study found that once
states tie standardized tests to graduation, fewer students
tend to get diplomas. After adopting such mandatory exit
exams, twice as many states had a graduation rate that fell
faster than the national average as those with a rate that
fell slower. Not surprisingly, then, dropout rates worsened
in 62 percent of the states, relative to the national
average, while enrollment of young people in programs
offering equivalency diplomas climbed. 
<p>
The reason for this is not solely that struggling students
grow frustrated and ultimately quit, the study concluded.
In an echo of the findings of other researchers, the
authors asserted that administrators, held responsible for
raising tests scores at a school or in an entire district,
occasionally pressure failing students to drop out. 
<p>
In lawsuits, educators have testified that students were
held back rather than promoted to a grade in which
high-stakes tests were administered, and that others were
expelled en masse shortly before testing days. But neither
those witnesses nor this study has been able to quantify
that circumstance nationally, or prove that it has
substantially influenced dropout rates. 
<p>
As the popularity of do-or-die exams has increased,
educators have vehemently argued their merits and
drawbacks, focusing mainly on individual states, like Texas
and Massachusetts, where their adoption has spurred the
most controversy. 
<p>
But this study is the first to have looked at the issue
nationally. The study examined graduation rates and scores
from a variety of tests in more than two dozen states that
have turned to do-or-die exams over the last two decades in
hopes of raising academic performance. 
<p>
"This is not research by press release, this is serious
work," said Sherman Dorn, a historian of education at the
University of South Florida who reviewed it. "What's very
clear is that the study challenges the conventional wisdom
that high-stakes testing improves academic achievement and
does not have unwanted consequences beyond that." 
<p>
The study has drawn its share of detractors, in no small
part because one of its authors, David Berliner, has been a
critic of school vouchers and other education proposals
often championed by conservatives. 
<p>
"I've gotten this reputation of being outspoken," Mr.
Berliner said. "Some call it ideological; I call it honest.
Either way, the data speaks for itself." 
<p>
Soundness of the data aside, some of Mr. Berliner's critics
question whether such tests are to blame for the poor
showings. 
<p>
"You almost never have a pure cause-and-effect
relationship," said Chester E. Finn, assistant secretary of
education in the Reagan administration. "Yes, you're
introducing high-stakes tests, but maybe you're also
changing the way you license teachers, or extending the
school day, or changing textbooks. There's always a lot of
things going on concurrently, so you really cannot peg
everything to the high-stakes tests." 
<p>
Other skeptics challenged the fairness of holding up the
SAT, the ACT, Advanced Placement tests and the national
math and reading exams as indicators of academic
performance, even if they are the only nationally
administered tests with which to measure one state against
another. 
<p>
For example, the National Assessment of Educational
Progress test, administered every four years, "gives us a
nice eyeball assessment, but the problem is it's given
infrequently," said Jay P. Greene, a senior fellow at the
Manhattan Institute who is working on a similar though more
limited study. 
<p>
"And the college entrance tests are very bad at judging
learning," he said, "because only a modest number of
students actually take the test." 
<p>
The criticism notwithstanding, many researchers said the
study fell within the bounds of what was already known
about make-or-break exams. Educators have long complained
that the threat of serious consequences means that teachers
focus on little else, sometimes building their lesson plans
entirely around the contents of the test. 
<p>
That would not necessarily be a problem if the state exams
were based on a comprehensive curriculum, said Eva Baker,
co-director of the National Center for Research on
Evaluation, Standards and Student Testing at U.C.L.A. But
as often as not, the state exams are given in the absence
of such a framework, leaving teachers to fill in the gaps
on their own, sometimes with an overzealous reliance on
test-taking drills. 
<p>
"The most perverse problem with high-stakes tests," Ms.
Baker said, "is that they have become a substitute for the
curriculum instead of simply a measure of it." 
<p>
Some researchers suggested that the study might have
actually understated the consequences of high-stakes tests,
particularly for dropout rates, because it relied on
government statistics. "Officially reported dropout
statistics are pretty suspect in a lot of places," said
Walter Haney, a professor at the Lynch School of Education
at Boston College, pointing out that students who leave
school to get a G.E.D. are not always counted as dropouts.
"The real results are probably worse." 
<p>
A larger question raised by the study is what effect, if
any, it will have on the public debate over high-stakes
testing. While many educators will most likely hold it up
as proof that such exams are flawed, largely because they
appear to offer inadvertent encouragement to schools to
constrain the curriculum and squeeze out underachievers,
others see the issue as more open-ended. 
<p>
"Should we just make better tests," asked Anthony G. Rud
Jr., associate professor of education at Purdue University,
or "is there something fundamentally wrong with testing in
this matter?"
